          was born in London on 28 November 1757 and was christened
          on 11 December in St. James's Church. His mother, born Catherine Wright, was married
          twice. Evidence has recently emerged that she and her first husband, a hosier named Thomas
          Armitage, were members of the Moravian Church (Davies and Schuchard), and some readers
          have detected echoes of Moravian hymns in Blake's poems. After Armitage died, Catherine
          left the Moravians and married James Blake, also a hosier. The Blakes kept a shop at 28
          Broad Street and were in their mid-thirties when William arrived. Of his brothers and
          sisters, Robert (1762-87) was Blake's favorite. His eldest brother, James (1753-1827), and
          a sister, Catherine (1764-1841), also figured prominently in his later life.</p>

        <p>As a child, Blake viewed the world in the light of what Wordsworth, in his <i>Ode:
            Intimations of Immortality</i>, would later call a "visionary gleam." When he was about
          nine, he told his parents he had seen "a tree filled with angels" on one of his walks; he
          later reported a similar vision of "angelic figures walking" in a field among workers as
          they gathered in the hay (Gilchrist 1: 7). Unlike the child in Wordsworth's poem, however,
          Blake never outgrew these visions. He was past fifty when he described seeing the rising
          sun as "an Innumerable company of the Heavenly host crying Holy Holy Holy is the Lord God
          Almighty" (Erdman 566).</p>

        <p>Blake's artistic ability also became evident while he was still a child. At age ten he
          was enrolled in Henry Pars's drawing school, where he learned to sketch the human figure
          by copying from plaster casts of ancient statues. His father encouraged his interest and
          even bought him some casts of his own. The influence of his early exposure to Greek and
          Roman sculpture can be seen in Blake's later work. The Farnese Hercules, for example, is
          the model for the figure of Giant Despair in <i>Christian and Hopeful Escape from Doubting
            Castle</i>, one of Blake's illustrations to Bunyan's <i>Pilgrim's Progress</i>
          (1824-27). In his last illuminated work, <i>Laoco&#246;n</i> (c. 1826-27), <sup>ill. 2</sup>

          he surrounds a well-known classical sculpture with his own commentary on art,
          religion, and commerce.</p>

        <p>Besides plaster casts, the young Blake also began to collect inexpensive prints from
          shops and auctions. His taste ran to Raphael, Michelangelo, Giulio Romano, Albrecht
          D&#252;rer, and Maerten Heemskerck, artists whose work was not widely appreciated at the
          time. He never wavered in his conviction that they were superior to the more fashionable
          painters of the Venetian and Flemish schools. In the catalogue for an exhibition of his
          own work in 1809, he accuses artists "who endeavour to raise up a style against Rafael,
          Mich. Angelo, and the Antique" of attempting to destroy art (Erdman 538).</p>

        <p>In 1772, having left Pars's school, the fourteen-year-old Blake began his apprenticeship
          under James Basire, engraver to the Society of Antiquaries and the Royal Society. Basire
          was best known for his simple line engravings&#8212;a style many of his contemporaries
          considered outdated, but one that fit well with Blake's preference for the firm outlines
          of artists like Albrecht D&#252;rer. Basire's usual subjects were antiquities and
          monuments, which he reproduced with austere precision; although he occasionally took on
          higher-profile projects, such as Benjamin West's <i>Pylades and Orestes</i>, these were
          the exception rather than the rule. Prominent artists like West tended to prefer the
          services of Basire's rivals, William Woollett (who engraved West's best-known painting,
            <i>The Death of General Wolfe</i>) and Robert Strange. Many years later, Blake,
          remembering the slight to his employer, would call these two men "heavy lumps of Cunning &
          Ignorance" (Erdman 573).</p>

        <p>In Basire's shop at 31 Great Queen Street in London, Blake learned the craft of copy
          engraving as it was practiced in England at the end of the eighteenth century. The
          standard method of preparing a copperplate for etching or engraving was time-consuming and
          labor-intensive. The original large sheet of copper had to be cut into appropriate sizes
          and the edges beveled to facilitate cleaning the ink off the plate and to prevent it from
          tearing the paper. The plate also had to be squared and its corners rounded, because the
          pressure of the printing press would leave an impression of the plate's edges in the
          paper. Next, the surface had to be polished, cleaned, and covered with an acid-resistant
          film, or "ground," which was then darkened with soot to contrast with the copper. Onto
          this ground the design was then transferred and traced with a needle to expose the plate's
          surface to acid, which bit the design into the copper (Viscomi, <i>Blake</i> 48-50). In a
          shop like Basire's , most of the tedious preparatory work was carried out by apprentices
          like Blake.</p>

        <p>It is difficult to know which of the works produced in Basire's shop during this period
          Blake himself may have engraved, because engravers' apprentices were discouraged from
          developing their own individual styles, and their work was usually signed by the master.
          Among the projects in which modern scholars believe Blake probably had a hand were Jacob
          Bryant's <i>A New System, or, an Analysis of Ancient Mythology</i> (1774-76) and Richard
          Gough's <i>Sepulchral Monuments in Great Britain</i>, Part I (published 1786). These books
          represent two subjects&#8212;mythology and British history&#8212;in which Blake never lost
          interest.</p>

        <p>Bryant was an antiquarian and mythographer who, like many others in the seventeenth and
          eighteenth centuries, attempted to reconcile pagan mythology with the biblical account of
          history. He theorized that the original monotheism of the <i>Old Testament</i> had
          degenerated after the Flood into various forms of sun worship, from which all the other
          pagan gods and heroes descended. His work had a lasting influence on Blake, who as late as
          1809 cites the authority of "Jacob Bryant, and all antiquaries" in support of his claim
          that "The antiquities of every Nation under Heaven" are equally sacred (Erdman 543).</p>

        <p>The plates for Gough's <i>Sepulchral Monuments</i> were engraved after pencil sketches
          Blake made of the tombs of kings and queens in Westminster Abbey. Basire is said to have
          given him that assignment in order to get him out of the shop and away from the dissension
          that was brewing among the newer apprentices (Bentley, <i>Blake Records</i> 422). Blake
          probably engraved a number of the sketches himself, including the portraits of Henry III,
          Eleanor of Castile, Edward III, and Richard II. <sup>ill. 3</sup>

           Eleanor in particular seems to have appealed to Blake's imagination,
          for he returned to her as a subject for the historical print <i>Edward &#38;Elenor</i>
          <sup>ill. 5</sup>

          and, much later, for one of his <i>Visionary Heads</i>. Edward III,
          meanwhile, reappears as the protagonist of a dramatic fragment in Blake's first volume of
          poetry, <i>Poetical Sketches</i> (1783).</p>

        <p>The earliest engraving that scholars can confidently attribute to Blake reflects his
          interest in early British history and legend. He later reworked and reprinted it with the
          title <i>Joseph of Arimathea among the Rocks of Albion</i>
          <sup>ill. 6</sup>

           and dated it 1773, the second year of his apprenticeship. The young
          Blake's technique in the first state of this work, though competent, does not reveal much
          about him as an artist; his distinctive imagination emerges only in the way he combines
          the compositional elements. He takes the pensive, muscular figure from Michelangelo's
            <i>Crucifixion of St. Peter</i>, but places him against a spare, brooding background of
          sea and rocky coast that evokes a mood reminiscent of the bleak seascapes of Anglo-Saxon
          verse. On the later state of this engraving, Blake identifies the figure as "One of the
          Gothic Artists who Built the Cathedrals in what we call the Dark Ages" (Erdman 671)&#8212;an
          allusion to the legend that Joseph of Arimathea traveled to Britain and founded
          Glastonbury Abbey.</p>
      

        <h2>
          <a name="1779" id="1779">2. Artist and Engraver, 1779-1788</a>
        </h2>

        <p>In 1779, at age twenty-one, Blake completed his seven-year apprenticeship with Basire and
          became a journeyman copy engraver, making his living by working on projects for London
          book and print publishers like Thomas Macklin, Harrison and Co., and Joseph Johnson.
          Macklin would later launch the <i>Poets' Gallery</i> (1788) and the <i>Macklin Bible</i>
          (1790)&#8212;commercial ventures aimed, like John Boydell's <i>Shakespeare Gallery</i>, at
          orchestrating a profitable combination of paintings, engravings, and literature. Blake's
          earliest separate prints were stipple engravings for Macklin of scenes by the French
          Rococo painter Jean-Antoine Watteau, whose work was known in England primarily through
          engravings. <sup><a>ill. 1<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/ES.XXII.2F.SP.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup>
          <sup><a>ill. 2<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/ES.XXIII.2F.SP.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> The stipple method, with its patterns of tiny dots, was well suited for
          reproducing his paintings, which emphasized color and tone over line. Although he never
          mentions Watteau by name, Blake later expresses contempt for this emphasis on color among
          painters of the Venetian school, of which Watteau was a direct heir.</p>

        <p>The summer of 1780 was an uneasy time in England. In June, violent anti-Catholic
          demonstrations, the Gordon Riots, spread through London, and Blake may have witnessed the
          destruction firsthand. Alexander Gilchrist reports that on 6 June, the third day of the
          riots, Blake was involuntarily swept along before a large mob and watched as it stormed
          and burned Newgate Prison (1: 35). Later that same summer, a sketching trip with Thomas
          Stothard and another friend on the River Medway brought Blake afoul of the law when the
          artists, mistaken for spies, were arrested for approaching too near to the great naval
          base on the Medway near Upnor Castle.</p>

        <p>Stothard was a versatile commercial artist and a prolific book illustrator, and Blake was
          one of several engravers who helped to popularize his works during the 1780s; others
          included James Heath and William Sharp. <i>The Novelist's Magazine</i>, published by
          Harrison and Co. in the early 1780s, showcased Stothard's picturesque wash drawings, which
          Blake, Heath, and Sharp reproduced in a uniform technique that preserved the fashionable
          style of the originals. <sup><a>ill. 3<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/BB.485.P2.COM.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> Blake also engraved some of Stothard's
          illustrations for books published by Joseph Johnson, including William Enfield's <i>The
            Speaker</i> (1780), <sup><a>ill. 4<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/BB.453.COM.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> the mathematician John Bonnycastle's
          <i>Introduction to Mensuration</i> (1782), <sup><a>ill. 5<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/BB.436.COM.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> and Joseph Ritson's <i>A
            Select Collection of English Songs</i> (1783).</p>

        <p>A number of Blake's other new friends in the early 1780s were professional or amateur
          artists. John Flaxman, a neoclassical sculptor whose illustrations of Homer, <sup><a>ill.
            6<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/BB.457.P1.COM.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> Aeschylus, and Dante would one day spread his fame throughout Europe, was then
          beginning his career as a designer for Josiah Wedgwood's popular line of classically
          inspired pottery. John Hawkins, a connoisseur, in 1784 tried unsuccessfully to raise
          enough money to send Blake to Italy, where he was to have completed his education in
          drawing by studying firsthand the works of the ancient sculptors and of Renaissance
          masters like Michelangelo and Raphael. George Cumberland, the author of <i>Thoughts on
            Outline</i> (1796), <sup><a>ill. 7<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/BB.447.P6.COM.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> was, like Flaxman, dedicated to reviving the
          classical style. "I study your outlines," Blake would write to him in 1799, "[. . .] just
          as if they were antiques" (Erdman 704).</p>

        <p>At the same time that he was working on commercial engraving projects, Blake was also
          preparing himself for a career as a painter. In 1779 he was admitted as a student to the
          Royal Academy of Art's Schools of Design. Founded in 1769 to promote English art and
          artists, the Royal Academy provided formal training and annual exhibitions. There Blake
          pursued his study of drawing, gaining admission after a probationary period to the
          Schools' collection of plaster casts of antique sculpture. <sup><a>ill. 8<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/BUT71.1.1.PD.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup>
          <sup><a>ill. 9<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/BUT72.1.recto.PD.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> Even as a student, Blake followed his own taste in art. When the elderly
          George Moser, Keeper of the Royal Academy, advised him to study Lebrun and Rubens instead
          of the "stiff" and "unfinished" works of Raphael and Michelangelo, the young Blake balked:
          "These things that you call Finishd are not Even Begun," he later reported himself as
          having replied; "how can they then, be Finishd?" (Erdman 639).</p>

        <p>Blake not only studied at the Royal Academy but exhibited his work there as well,
          beginning in 1780 with <i>The Death of Earl Goodwin</i>, <sup><a>ill. 10<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/BUT60.1.1.WC.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> one of a
          series of watercolor drawings on the early history of England that also included such
          subjects as <i>The Landing of Brutus</i>, <i>The Making of Magna Carta</i>, <sup><a>ill.
            11<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/BUT.62.WC.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> and <i>The Penance of Jane Shore</i>. In 1784, Blake exhibited a pair of
          thematically related works, <i>A Breach in a City the Morning after the Battle and War
            Unchaind by an Angel. Fire, Pestilence, and Famine Following</i>, <sup><a>ill. 12<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/BUT.186.r.WD.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup>
          depicting the ravages of war. The following year, he exhibited four works: <i>The Bard,
            from Gray</i> and three drawings illustrating the biblical story of Joseph and his
          brothers, the latter reflecting an increasing interest in <i>Old Testament</i> subjects.
          In all these drawings, Blake adheres to the prevailing neoclassical style as interpreted
          by such contemporary artists as James Barry.</p>

        <p>Blake's creative activities were not confined to the visual arts during these years. The
          early 1780s also saw the private publication of <i>Poetical Sketches</i> (1783), a
          collection of poems he had written over the previous fourteen years. These early efforts
          echo Blake's English precursors from Spenser to the eighteenth century but also
          demonstrate his willingness to experiment with form and language. The series of four
          season poems that opens the volume suggests the range of influences the young poet had
          absorbed, drawing on sources as diverse as the <i>Song of Solomon</i> and the northern
          sublime popularized by James Macpherson's poems of <i>Ossian</i>. Blake's independent
          views in both aesthetics and politics are evident even in his first book: <i>To the
            Muses</i> explicitly critiques contemporary verse, accusing the muses of turning their
          backs on poetry altogether, and the fragmentary historical drama <i>King Edward the
            Third</i> explores the problematic role of war and imperialism in English history.</p>

        <p>The publication of <i>Poetical Sketches</i> was financed by Flaxman and two of his
          friends, the Rev. A. S. Mathew and his wife Harriet, who hosted literary and artistic
          gatherings to which Blake had recently begun to be invited. One of those who attended
          frequently was Thomas Taylor, whose lectures on Greek philosophy, soon to be followed by
          translations from Plotinus, Proclus, and the Platonic dialogues, earned him the nickname
          "the Platonist." Blake eventually became disillusioned with the Mathew circle; his
          unfinished satire <i>An Island in the Moon</i> (c. 1784-85) <sup><a>ill. 13<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/BB74.1.P8.MS.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> is a lively sendup of
          their social ambitions and affectations. Under names like "Inflammable Gass," "Sipsop the
          Pythagorean," and "Mrs. Nannicantipot," Blake's fellow guests gossip, philosophize, and
          show off their latest inventions, bursting frequently into song&#8212;and, at least once, into
          flame.</p>

        <p>Blake's companion throughout these eventful years was Catherine Boucher (1762-1831), whom
          he had married in 1782. He had met his future wife, the daughter of a market gardener,
          during a stay in Battersea. Recently rejected by another woman, Blake told Catherine the
          story of his unsuccessful courtship; she pitied him and in turn won his affection
          (Bentley, <i>Blake Records</i> 517-18). The two were married 18 August at the church of
          St. Mary in Battersea and moved to 23 Green Street in London. Their marriage was by all
          accounts happy; one of the few recorded exceptions occurred when Catherine quarreled with
          Blake's beloved younger brother Robert, and Blake insisted she kneel down and apologize to
          him (Gilchrist 1: 58-59).</p>

        <p>In 1784, Blake set up a printing and publishing partnership at 27 Broad Street with James
          Parker, who had also worked as an apprentice under Basire. The business apparently did not
          thrive. Only two prints, <i>Zephyrus and Flora</i>
          <sup><a>ill. 14<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/ES.XXVI.2C.SP.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> and <i>Calisto</i>, <sup><a>ill. 15<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/ES.XXVII.2B.SP.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> separate plates on mythological
          themes engraved by Blake after Stothard, are known to have been produced (Essick 141). The
          Blake-Parker partnership appears to have broken up by the end of 1785, and the Blakes
          moved to 28 Poland Street. Blake did little commercial engraving over the next two years,
          but 1788 was busier, culminating in a commission from the Boydells for Blake's biggest
          commercial project of the decade: a large engraving of William Hogarth's <i>The Beggar's
            Opera, Act III</i>. <sup><a>ill. 16<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/BB.475.COM.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> The painting depicts a performance of John Gay's
          famous ballad opera, the story of the highwayman MacHeath. The engraving took Blake nearly
          two years to complete.</p>

        </h2>

        <p>At the same time that he was working on these commercial projects, Blake was searching
          for a better way to print and publish his own work. About 1788, he invented relief
          etching, a process that was both more efficient and potentially more expressive and
          autographic than traditional intaglio etching. In intaglio graphics, the design must be
          transferred to the metal plate: either scratched lightly onto the waxed surface and then
          deepened with an engraving tool, such as a burin, or traced with a needle into an
          acid-resistant coating, the exposed pattern of lines and dots then being bitten into the
          plate with acid. Blake's contemporaries usually tried to optimize quality and efficiency
          by combining these techniques in "mixed-method" engraving. In relief etching, on the other
          hand, the design is painted directly onto the copperplate using an acid-resistant varnish.
          When acid is applied to the plate, the unpainted surface, rather than the design itself,
          is eaten away, while the design is left standing in relief to be inked and printed.
          Because the design is above rather than below the surface of the plate, a relief etching
          also requires less pressure to print than a conventional intaglio etching or engraving.
          The printed version of a relief etching is, of course, a mirror image of the original
          design; this means that any text to be included must be written backwards. As a trained
          copy engraver, however, Blake had already had an opportunity to practice this skill.</p>

        <p>It was Blake's late brother Robert who, according to John Thomas Smith, directed Blake
          toward this discovery. Robert had died in February 1787; Blake, who had remained
          constantly at his bedside for two weeks and reportedly collapsed into a continuous sleep
          for three days and nights after his death (Gilchrist 1: 59), continued to see his brother
          in visions. The following year, Robert appeared to him in such a vision and instructed him
          in a new method of printing his works without "the expense of letter-press" (Bentley,
            <i>Blake Records</i> 460). Appropriately, one of Blake's first experiments in this
          medium was <i>The Approach of Doom</i>, <sup><a>ill. 1<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/ESIII.1.1.SP.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> a print based on one of Robert's
          drawings. <sup><a>ill. 2<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/BUTR2.1.1r.WD.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> The real importance of relief etching for Blake, however, was
          not economic but aesthetic: unlike other methods of printing texts and designs available
          at the end of the eighteenth century, it did not separate invention from production. The
          need to keep these two activities united became one of Blake's central tenets as an
          artist.</p>

        <p>Blake continued to employ relief etching in his first two illuminated books, <i>All
            Religions are One</i> and <i>There is No Natural Religion</i> (both c. 1788). <sup><a>ill.
              3<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/aro.A.P2.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup>ill. 4<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/nnr.G.P2-a2.100.pre.jpg"/></p>
          </sup> His decision to present their texts in the form of aphorisms (or
          "Principles," as he calls them in <i>All Religions are One</i>) may have been inspired
          partly by the English translation of Johann Caspar Lavater's <i>Aphorisms on Man</i>
        (1788), <sup><a>ill. 5<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/BB.480.COM.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> for which Blake engraved the frontispiece. The two tractates are
          part of Blake's lifelong quarrel with the philosophy of Bacon, Newton, and Locke.
          Rejecting the rational empiricism of eighteenth-century deism or "natural religion," which
          looked to the material world for evidence of God's existence, Blake offers as an
          alternative the imaginative faculty or "Poetic Genius."</p>

        <p>Much better known is Blake's next illuminated book, <i>Songs of Innocence</i> (1789),
          <sup><a>ill. 6<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/s-inn.B.P2-3.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> a collection of short lyric poems and their accompanying designs.
          Deceptively simple at first reading, the <i>Songs</i> have affinities with
          eighteenth-century children's literature but go beyond the traditional children's book to
          question some of the unexamined assumptions of adult society. "Every child may joy to
          hear" such songs (Erdman 7), but some adults in Blake's audience might well have been
          uncomfortable with the social critique implicit in such poems as <i>The Chimney Sweeper,
            Holy Thursday,</i> or <i>Night</i>. The nature of illuminated printing allowed the
          Blakes (Catherine assisted with the printing and hand coloring) to maintain control over
          the entire process of producing and marketing <i>Songs</i> and subsequent illuminated
          books.</p>

        <p>Later in the same year Blake produced <i>The Book of Thel</i>, <sup><a>ill. 7<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/thel.O.P1-2.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> an
          illuminated poem in unrhymed lines of fourteen syllables. Numerous allegorical
          interpretations have been suggested for this story of a young shepherdess who receives
          advice from a lily, a cloud, and a clod of clay, only to flee in the end from a "voice of
          sorrow" that rises from "her own grave plot" (Erdman 6). The designs present her as a pale
          and slender figure, clothed in a wispy gown, conversing with her anthropomorphic mentors
          in a world defined by delicate watercolor washes.</p>

        <p>A very different kind of illuminated book grew out of Blake's disillusionment with
          Emanuel Swedenborg, a Swedish mystic in whose work he had begun to take an interest. Blake
          read and annotated at least three of Swedenborg's books, and he and Catherine attended a
          meeting of the Swedenborgian New Jerusalem Church in April 1789. By 1790, however,
          interest had turned to opposition. <i>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</i> (1790) <sup><a>ill.
            8<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/mhh.I.P1.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> apparently began as a four-page anti-Swedenborgian pamphlet (Viscomi, "Lessons"
          173), but it quickly grew into a full-blown satire flexible enough to accommodate a
          mixture of prose and verse, with settings spanning heaven and hell and a cast of
          characters that includes angels and devils, <i>Old Testament</i> prophets, John Milton,
          and Swedenborg himself. The section titled <i>Proverbs of Hell</i> contains some of
          Blake's best-known aphorisms, such as "The road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom"
          (Erdman 35).</p>

        <p>Blake apparently intended to publish his narrative poem <i>Tiriel</i> (c. 1789) <sup><a>ill.
          9<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/BUT198.1.1.WD.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup>
          <sup><a>ill. 10<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/BUT198.1.4.WD.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> in conventional letterpress with intaglio engravings, but it remained
          in manuscript accompanied by twelve wash drawings. Tiriel, a tyrant who curses his own
          children, has affinities with both Sophocles's Oedipus and Shakespeare's King Lear. The
          poem's echoes of Greek tragedy and the designs' strong classical associations may
          initially strike readers as derivative, but despite its traditional elements,
            <i>Tiriel</i> is noteworthy as one of Blake's earliest experiments in constructing his
          own mythic world.</p>

        <p>Another letterpress project that was never completed, <i>The French Revolution</i>
          (1791), progressed as far as the page proofs of the first book, printed for Joseph
          Johnson. Although the title page announces "A Poem, in Seven Books," only <i>Book the
            First</i> is known to exist. Based on the events of 1789, it mixes fact with fiction,
          though the proportion of history to myth is much higher than in later prophetic poems like
            <i>America</i>
          <sup><a>ill. 11<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/america.O.P2.100.pre.jpg"/</img></sup> and <i>Europe</i>. <sup><a>ill. 12<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/europe.K.P2.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup>
        </p>

        <p>In addition to his own manuscripts and illuminated books, Blake continued during the
          1790s to engrave illustrations for London booksellers, particularly Joseph Johnson. To the
          third volume of <i>The Antiquities of Athens</i> (1794), <sup><a>ill. 13<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/BB.500.P4.COM.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> James Stuart
          and Nicholas Revett's monumental work on classical architecture, Blake contributed four
          engravings after W. Pars of sculptures from the Temple of Theseus(Bentley, <i>Blake
            Books</i> 624). For Erasmus Darwin's scientific poem <i>The Botanic Garden</i>
          (1791-1806), he engraved designs after Fuseli (<i>Fertilization of Egypt and Tornado</i>)
          <sup><a>ill. 14<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/BB.450.P1.COM.100.pre.jpg"/</img></sup>
          <sup><a>ill. 15<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/BUT173.1.1Fuseli.PD.100.pre.jpg"/</img></sup>
          <sup><a>ill. 16<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/BB.450.P6.COM.100.pre.jpg"/></sup> and illustrations of the famous Portland Vase. Darwin's poem and its
          copious notes probably suggested some of the biological and geological imagery that
          appears in Blake's illuminated books of the mid-1790s.</p>

        <p>While engraving John Gabriel Stedman's designs for his <i>Narrative, of a Five Years'
            Expedition, Against the Revolted Negroes of Surinam</i> (1796), a firsthand account of a
          slave rebellion, Blake became a close friend of the author. Though not an abolitionist,
          Stedman deplored the inhuman conditions to which Africans were subjected on sugar and
          tobacco plantations. His graphic descriptions and depictions of the torture inflicted by
          the slave owners offended some contemporary readers, but critics praised the quality of
          the illustrations. <sup<a>ill. 17<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/BB.499.c.P2.COM.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup>
          <sup><a>ill. 18<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/BB.499.c.P8.COM.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup>

        </p>

        <p>Blake both composed and engraved the six designs for Mary Wollstonecraft's <i>Original
            Stories from Real Life</i> (1791), a work of didactic fiction that offers an alternative
          to the eighteenth-century ideal of woman as an emotional creature of more sensibility than
          sense. Most of the illustrations depict the rational Mrs. Mason's efforts to teach her two
          young female students the importance of charity and compassion by exposing them to scenes
          of poverty and suffering. <sup><a>ill. 20<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/BB514.1.1.COM.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup>

        </p>

        <p>His work for Johnson during the 1790s may have given Blake an opportunity to meet some of
          the more prominent radical thinkers and writers in England. Besides Wollstonecraft, whose
            <i>A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</i> (1792) attacked contemporary notions about
          women's education and role in society, the Johnson circle included William Godwin, the
          author of <i>Political Justice</i> (1794); Thomas Holcroft, who was tried on charges of
          high treason in 1794 along with John Horne Tooke; Joseph Priestley, the prominent chemist
          and radical; and Thomas Paine, author of <i>The Rights of Man</i> (1791-92), who fled
          England in 1792 to avoid arrest&#8212;tipped off, it was rumored, by Blake himself: "Blake
          advised him immediately to fly, for he said 'if you are not now sought I am sure you soon
          will be.' Paine took the hint directly &#38;found he had just escaped in time" (Bentley,
            <i>Blake Records</i> 530). The story may well be apocryphal, but it reveals the extent
          to which Blake's name was associated with those of the leading radical figures of the
          decade.</p>

        <p>The member of Johnson's circle who played the most important role in Blake's life,
          however, was Henry Fuseli, a Swiss artist who had emigrated to England. He and Blake
          greatly admired each other's work: Blake considered Fuseli a century ahead of his time
          (Bentley, <i>Blake Records Supplement</i> 80), while Fuseli, for his part, pronounced
          Blake "<i>d----d good to steal from</i>" (Gilchrist 1: 52). The two formed a close
          friendship, and Blake engraved a number of Fuseli's designs, both for book illustrations
          and as separate plates. <sup><a>ill. 22<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/ESXXXIV.1.1.SP.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup>
        </p>

        <p>When Blake returned to illuminated printing in 1793 after a three-year hiatus, his new
          books shared some themes prominent among the authors Johnson published. Oothoon, the
          victimized heroine of <i>Visions of the Daughters of Albion</i> (1793), <sup><a>ill. 23<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/vda.O.P2.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup>
          adds her eloquent lament to the discourse on slavery and the rights of women. <i>America a
            Prophecy</i> (1793), the first of Blake's Continental Prophecies, treats the American
          Revolution as an event with mythological as well as historical dimensions. Paine makes an
          appearance here, as do Washington, Franklin, and other American luminaries, but so do new
          figures from Blake's personal mythology: Urizen, <sup><a>ill. 24<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/america.O.P10.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> the wintry oppressor,
          and Orc, <sup><a>ill. 25<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/america.O.P12.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> the fiery revolutionary, who act out the conflict on a cosmic
          scale. <i>For Children: The Gates of Paradise</i>, <sup><a>ill. 26<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/gates-child.D.P1.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup>
          <sup><a>ill. 27<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/gates-child.D.P2.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> an emblem book comprising eighteen small intaglio etchings accompanied
          by brief inscriptions on the human condition, also appeared in 1793. Blake later revised
          the work as <i>For the Sexes</i> (c. 1820). <sup><a>ill. 28<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/gates-sexes.D.P1.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup>

        <a name="1793" id="1793">4. Illustrated Books and Separate Prints, 1793-1799</a>
      </h2>

      <p>Besides illuminated books, Blake designed and executed a number of separate plates in 1793.
        Although he produced many watercolor drawings of subjects from British history, <i>Edward &
          Elenor</i> (1793) <sup><a>ill. 1<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/ESIV.1.1B.SP.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> is his only known engraving in that genre. It
        commemorates the moment when, according to legend, the queen risked her own life to suck the
        poison out of her husband's wound. Blake's <i>Job</i> (1793) <sup><a>ill. 2<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/ES.V.1A.SP.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> grew out of
        drawings dating from the 1780s, and he revised the design for one of his Job watercolors of
        c. 1805. <sup><a>ill. 3<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/BUT550.1.P10.WC.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> In <i>Albion rose</i> (1793), also known as <i>Glad Day or The
          Dance of Albion</i>, a triumphant young male nude stands with outstretched arms before a
        glorious sunburst. <sup><a>ill. 4<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/BUT262.1.1.CPD.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> Contrasting with his open and unselfconscious posture
        are <i>The Accusers of Theft Adultery Murder</i> (1793), who, though armed, crowd stiffly
        together in fright. <sup><a>ill. 5<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/BUT262.1.2.CPD.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> Both these designs have affinities with the
        revolutionary themes of <i>America</i>: the vigorous young Albion suggests the youthful
        revolutionary Orc, while the title of the first state of <i>The Accusers</i> echoes the
        prediction in <i>America</i> that the tyrants' "end should come" with the French Revolution
        (Erdman 57).</p>

      <p>In his next Continental Prophecy, <i>Europe: a Prophecy</i> (1794), Blake continued to mix
        his personal mythology with history and the ongoing conflicts of his own times. The
        frontispiece design to this book is perhaps the most familiar of all Blake's images: an old
        man, his long white hair and beard blown to one side, kneeling in an orb surrounded by
        clouds and reaching one arm down to apply a pair of compasses to some unseen realm below.
        <sup><a>ill. 6<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/europe.K.P1.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> In the poem, the eighteen centuries of Christian history become a
        "female dream" of Enitharmon (Erdman 63), whose son Orc illuminates "the vineyards of red
        France" with the light of revolution (Erdman 66).</p>

      <p>In 1794, Blake produced a second collection of lyrics, <i>Songs of Experience</i>,
        <sup><a>ill. 7<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/songsie.C.P30-29.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> as a companion volume for his earlier <i>Songs of Innocence</i>. He
        intended the two sets of poems, which he combined as <i>Songs of Innocence and of
          Experience</i>, to illustrate "the Two Contrary States of the Human Soul" (Erdman 7).
        <sup><a>ill. 8<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/songsie.AA.P1.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> In one of the most anthologized poems in the English language, <i>The
          Tyger</i>, Blake frames this opposition as a question of origins. When the child in
          <i>Innocence</i> asks, "Little Lamb who made thee" (Erdman 8), he is already sure of the
        answer, but the question the adult speaker of <i>Experience</i> poses to the Tyger&#8212; "Did he
        who made the Lamb make thee?" (Erdman 25)&#8212;resists any such certainty.</p>

      <p>The problem of origins is also central to the Urizen Books, a series of interrelated
        illuminated poems whose myths echo&#8212;and subvert&#8212; <i>Genesis, Paradise Lost</i>, and other
        traditional creation narratives. In Blake's version, the act of creation is itself a fall
        into the material world, where flawed creators struggle with each other and with the
        intractable elements of the cosmos. The most ambitious work in this series is <i>The [First]
          Book of Urizen</i> (1794), <sup><a>ill. 9<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/urizen.F.P1.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> a poem in nine chapters generously
        illustrated with relief-etched designs. Two related poems, <i>The Book of Ahania</i>
        <sup><a>ill. 10<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/ahania.A.P2.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> and <i>The Book of Los</i>, <sup><a>ill. 11<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/b-los.A.P2.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> followed in 1795. These
        are briefer and less lavishly illustrated than <i>Urizen</i>, and their texts are etched in
        intaglio rather than relief. In the same year, Blake produced his final Continental
        Prophecy, <i>The Song of Los</i>, <sup><a>ill. 12<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/s-los.A.P2.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> consisting of <i>Africa</i> and
          <i>Asia</i>. In these last three illuminated books, Blake was experimenting with color
        printing techniques he would employ in his next major graphic project.</p>

      <p>The twelve large color-printed drawings of 1795 represent the culmination of Blake's
        experiments with a new color-printing technique using opaque, glue-based pigments. The
        subjects of these designs range from the creation of Adam to the discoveries of Sir Isaac
        Newton, and include scenes from the <i>Old Testament</i>, Shakespeare, and Blake's own
        mythology. <i>Lamech and His Two Wives</i>, <sup><a>ill. 13<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/BUT.298.CPD.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> based on an obscure and
        infrequently illustrated passage in Genesis 4:23-24, pictures the destructive passions that
        lead to murder and regret in the fallen world. An equally dire fate awaits those who come to
        <i>The House of Death</i>, <sup><a>ill. 14<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/BUT.322.CPD.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> a design based on a passage in Milton's
          <i>Paradise Lost</i> also illustrated by Fuseli. <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>
        <sup><a>ill. 15<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/BUT302.CPD.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> shows an even lower mental and physical state&#8212;the human reduced to the
        animalistic. It has been suggested recently that the color print traditionally titled
          <i>Hecate</i>
        <sup><a>ill. 16<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/BUT318.P1.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> should actually be called <i>The Night of Enitharmon's Joy</i>. Such a
        change in title shifts the subject of the print from the traditional witch and moon goddess
        Hecate to Blake's own mythological representations of the natural world as a place of
        joyless repression. Enitharmon, as the reigning deity of such a world, separates and casts
        spells upon the youthful male and female behind her. Like the full-page designs for <i>The
          Song of Los</i>, <i>The Book of Los</i>, and <i>Ahania</i>, they were printed from a flat
        surface instead of a relief-etched plate.</p>

      <p>In the same year, the bookseller and publisher Richard Edwards commissioned Blake to
        illustrate Edward Young's <i>Night Thoughts</i>, a long didactic poem in blank verse that
        had achieved great popularity on the continent as well as in England. It was the biggest
        commercial project Blake would ever undertake. Within two years, he produced 537 watercolor
        designs to fit in large margins around rectangular blocks of Young's text set in
        letterpress. <sup><a>ill. 17<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/BUT330.1.78.WC.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup>
        <sup><a>ill. 18<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/BUT330.1.87.WC.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> For this prodigious effort, he reportedly received only twenty-one
        pounds. Blake engraved forty-three of his designs for the first of four projected volumes,
        which was also the last: Edwards went out of business not long after it appeared in 1797,
        and the project was abandoned. <sup><a>ill. 19<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/BB515.1.24.COM.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup>
      </p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Blake had begun work on his own long poem, divided, like Young's <i>Night
          Thoughts</i>, into nine "Nights." Originally titled <i>Vala</i>, the epic evolved into
          <i>The Four Zoas</i>, an exploration of the fourfold division of fallen consciousness. It
        remained in manuscript, heavily revised and accompanied by designs that, like his <i>Night
          Thoughts</i> illustrations, surround the text. Blake eventually abandoned the poem,
        probably around 1807, but used material from it in his two later epics, <i>Milton</i>
        <sup><a>ill. 20<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/milton.D.P1.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> and <i>Jerusalem</i>. <sup><a>ill. 21<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/jerusalem.E.P2.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> Blake's work on <i>Night
          Thoughts</i> also influenced a project very different from <i>The Four Zoas</i>: his
        watercolor illustrations for the poems of Thomas Gray, which Flaxman commissioned in 1797 as
        a present for his wife, Ann. By the following year Blake had completed a series of 116
        watercolor designs around the letterpress text of Gray's poems. <sup><a>ill. 22<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/but.335.7.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup>
        <sup><a>ill. 23<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/but.335.18.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup>
      </p>

      <p>After spending two years on the ill-fated <i>Night Thoughts</i>, Blake had difficulty
        finding work as an engraver. "I am laid by in a corner as if I did not Exist," he complained
        to Cumberland in 1799; "Even Johnson &#38;Fuseli have discarded my Graver" (Erdman 704). As
        the decade drew to a close, he became increasingly dependent on private patrons. One of the
        most important of these was Thomas Butts, <sup><a>ill. 24<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/BUT376.1.1.PT.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> who, beginning about 1799,
        commissioned paintings on biblical subjects in watercolors and in an experimental medium
        Blake called "tempera" or "fresco." These commissions provided Blake with the creative
        latitude he craved and the financial support he needed: between 1803 and 1810, they brought
        in some 400 pounds (Bentley, <i>Stranger</i> 186), one of Blake's few reliable sources of
        income during those lean years.</p>
   
    <h2>
      <a name="1800" id="1800">5. Departure and Return, 1800-1808</a>
    </h2>

    <p>In 1800 Blake left London and moved to a cottage near the home of another patron, William
      Hayley, in Felpham, Sussex. Hayley was a popular poet, the author of <i>Essays on
        Sculpture</i> (1800), for which Blake engraved three plates, including a portrait of
      Hayley's son Tom, a student of Flaxman. <sup><a>ill. 1<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/BB.467.P3.COM.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> The two found common ground in Tom's
      death in May 1800; Blake, recalling his brother Robert's death thirteen years earlier, wrote
      to Hayley "with a brothers Sympathy" for his loss (Erdman 705). Two months later, Blake
      visited Hayley at Felpham and was soon making preparations to move there. Eager to leave
      London and full of optimism about his new life in Sussex, he wrote to Hayley in September, "My
      fingers Emit sparks of fire with Expectations of my future labours" (Erdman 709).</p>

    <p>The stay at Felpham began auspiciously enough. Blake found the place "more Spiritual than
      London," as he wrote to Flaxman on his arrival: "Heaven opens here on all sides her golden
      Gates [. . .] voices of Celestial inhabitants are more distinctly heard &#38;their forms more
      distinctly seen" (Erdman 710). The following May, in a letter to Butts, he was still calling
      Felpham "the sweetest spot on Earth" (Erdman 715). <sup><a>ill. 2<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/milton.C.P39-36.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> Blake continued to work
      on commissions for Butts, while Hayley kept him busy executing plates for his <i>Life of
        Cowper</i>, <sup><a>ill. 3<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/BB.468.P1.COM.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> illustrating his <i>Ballads</i> (1802), <sup><a>ill. 4<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/BB.466.P12.COM.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> and
      even decorating his library with portraits of poets.</p>

    <p>As time went on, however, Blake began to resent Hayley's insistence that he spend his time on
      such projects at the expense of his own artistic and poetic endeavors. He came to believe
      that, as he later wrote in <i>Milton</i>, "Corporeal Friends are Spiritual Enemies" (Erdman
      98). Hayley was certainly trying to be a corporeal friend, looking out for Blake's financial
      interests, teaching him Greek and Latin, and worrying about his mental health. This last role
      was a familiar one for Hayley: eight years earlier, he had befriended the poet William Cowper
      and had tried unsuccessfully to intervene in his struggle with insanity. Blake, however, was
      not Cowper. Many years later, in his annotations to Spurzheim's <i>Observations on
        Insanity</i> (1817), he recorded a vision in which Cowper told him, "You retain health
      &#38;yet are as mad as any of us all [. . .] mad as a refuge from unbelief&#8212;from Bacon Newton
      &#38;Locke" (Erdman 663).</p>

    <p>By 1803, Blake had decided to leave Felpham, but before he could do so an incident occurred
      that redoubled his distress. On 12 August, he found a soldier, John Scolfield, in the garden
      and insisted that he leave. The soldier refused, the two argued, and in the end Blake evicted
      him by force. Scolfield accused Blake not only of assault but of sedition, claiming he had
      damned the king, and Blake was indicted on the charges in October. The penalties for sedition
      in England during the Napoleonic wars were severe, and Blake spent the fall of 1803 in
      anguish, uncertain of his fate. Hayley hired a barrister to defend him, and he was acquitted
      the following January. Meanwhile, he and Catherine had moved back to London, renting rooms at
      17 South Molton Street.</p>

    <p>Blake's first major commercial project after his return to London was a set of illustrations
      for <i>The Grave</i>, a didactic blank-verse poem by Robert Blair. <sup><a>ill. 5<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/BB435.1.11.COM.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> The
      publisher, Robert H. Cromek, paid Blake a small sum in 1805 for about twenty designs, with the
      understanding that he would engrave fifteen for publication. After seeing Blake's etching of
      <i>Deaths Door</i>, <sup><a>ill. 6<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/ES.XIII.SP.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> however, Cromek changed his mind. He saw the
      ruggedness produced by Blake's innovative use of white-line etching as mere carelessness
      (Bentley, <i>Blake Records</i> 172) and decided to turn over the engraving of Blake's designs
      to the more fashionable Louis Schiavonetti. As with Young's <i>Night Thoughts</i>, Blake had
      invested considerable effort and hope in a project that in the end seemed to have been pulled
      out from under him. Cromek also rejected Blake's dedicatory vignette <i>To the Queen</i>,
      <sup><a>ill. 7<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/BUT620.1.1.WC.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> but did include a portrait of Blake himself engraved after Thomas
      Phillips. <sup><a>ill. 8<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/BB435-K8b.1.1.COM.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> To the extent that Blake's name was known in the early nineteenth
      century, it was largely as the artist of the <i>Grave</i> designs.</p>

    <p>While <i>The Grave</i> was still in progress, Blake began work on what was to become his
      largest original separate plate, a one-by-three-foot intaglio etching of <i>Chaucers
        Canterbury Pilgrims</i>. <sup><a>ill. 9<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/ES.XVI.5GG.SP.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> Blake later told Linnell that Cromek had offered
      him twenty-one pounds for a painting of the subject, "with the understanding that the
      remuneration for the whole would be made adequate by the price to be paid to Blake for the
      Engraving which Blake stipulated he should execute" (Bentley, <i>Blake Records</i> 464n).
      Blake became suspicious of Cromek's intentions and refused to part with the painting; he later
      learned that Cromek had commissioned a similar design from his friend Stothard. Although
      Stothard was probably unaware of Cromek's prior arrangement with Blake, both men became
      thieves in Blake's eyes. Blake engraved and attempted to market his own design, but it did not
      sell well.</p>

    <h2>
      <a name="1809" id="1809">6. Exhibition and Illuminated Epics, 1809-1818</a>
    </h2>

    <p>In 1809, Blake exhibited <i>Chaucers Canterbury Pilgrims</i> along with fifteen other
      paintings in his brother's shop at 28 Broad Street. The <i>Descriptive Catalogue</i> that he
      published to accompany the exhibit is as much an aesthetic manifesto as a catalogue. In it he
      defends his interpretation of Chaucer's characters, presents his case against Venetian and
      Flemish painting, and argues that all great art must be based on the "distinct, sharp, and
      wirey [. . .] bounding line" (Erdman 558). Among the other works on display were <i>The Bard,
        from Gray</i>; <i>Satan Calling Up His Legions</i>; and a pair of temperas representing the
      "spiritual forms" of Nelson and Pitt. By far the largest painting exhibited was <i>The Ancient
        Britons</i>, a ten-by-fourteen-foot canvas (now lost) depicting three survivors of "the last
      Battle of King Arthur" (Erdman 542). It had been commissioned by William Owen Pughe, a Welsh
      antiquarian described by Robert Southey as a "good simple-hearted, Welsh-headed man, [. . .]
      whose memory is the great storehouse of all Cymric tradition and lore of every kind" (Bentley,
        <i>Blake Records</i> 226). The three surviving Britons in the painting, according to Blake,
      represent "the human sublime," "the human pathetic," and "the human reason": "They were
      originally one man, who was fourfold: he was self-divided, and his real humanity slain on the
      stems of generation" (Erdman 543). This division of the fourfold man was the subject of
      Blake's own epic poems: the abandoned <i>Four Zoas</i> manuscript and the two illuminated
      books, <i>Milton</i>
      <sup><a>ill. 1<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/milton.D.P1.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> and <i>Jerusalem</i>, <sup><a>ill. 2<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/jerusalem.E.P2.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> that grew out of it.</p>

    <p>The title page of <i>Milton a Poem</i> (c. 1804-18) is dated 1804, but it was not until c.
      1811 that Blake produced the first three copies, and he continued working on the fourth until
      c. 1818. The poem is divided into two parts: in the first, Milton, inspired by a bard's song,
      descends from heaven and returns to earth in order to correct the errors he had left behind;
      in the second, Milton's female "emanation," Ololon, also returns to earth, and the poem
      culminates in their apocalyptic union. Throughout <i>Milton</i>, Blake manipulates time and
      space in unconventional ways, and his characters' identities change with disconcerting ease.
      In the designs, Blake experimented with new etching techniques that give the book a rough,
      primitive appearance. <sup><a>ill. 3<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/milton.A.P38.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup>
    </p>

    <p><i>Jerusalem: The Emanation of the Giant Albion</i>, at 100 plates Blake's longest
      illuminated book, took even longer to complete. Also dated 1804 on its title page, it was not
      printed in its entirety until about 1820. By the end of his life, Blake had hand-colored one
      copy, but he was unable to find a buyer for it. The poem tells of efforts to awaken the
      self-divided and sleeping giant Albion and reunite him with his female portion (or emanation),
      Jerusalem. Albion's cruel sons and daughters and the nature goddess Vala impose obstacles and
      temptations, but Los (the artist's imagination) eventually triumphs, with the help of Jesus,
      who is more prominent here than in any of Blake's other illuminated books.</p>

    <p>While writing his epic <i>Milton</i>, Blake was also at work on several series of watercolor
      drawings illustrating John Milton's own poems. He had already produced a set of designs for
      <i>Comus</i> for the Rev. Joseph Thomas in 1801. <sup><a>ill. 4<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/BUT.527.P1.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> Now he illustrated
      <i>Paradise Lost</i> (1807) <sup><a>ill. 5<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/BUT.529.P1.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> and the <i>Nativity Ode</i> (1809) <sup><a>ill.
        6<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/BUT538.1.1.WC.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> for Thomas and began producing designs for the same three poems for Butts as well.
      He later added illustrations for <i>L'Allegro</i> and <i>Il Penseroso</i> (c. 1816-20)
      <sup><a>ill. 7<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/BUT543.1.P1.WC.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup>
      <sup><a>ill. 8<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/BUT543.1.P8.WC.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> and <i>Paradise Regained</i> (1821). <sup><a>ill. 9<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/BUT.544.1.WC.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> Besides much-needed
      income, Blake's Milton illustrations provided him with another vehicle for interpreting the
      works of his predecessor as an epic poet.</p>

    <p>Despite his efforts, the decade from 1808 to 1818 was not a profitable one for Blake. His
      one-man show in 1809 had not been a success. His dealings with Cromek had left him feeling
      bitter and cheated. Commercial work was scarce; there is no record of his having produced any
      commercial engravings from 1806 to 1813. During the second half of the decade he was at work
      on Flaxman's illustrations to Hesiod <sup><a>ill. 10<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/BB.456.P5.COM.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> as well as plates for Rees's
        <i>Cyclopaedia</i>
      <sup><a>ill. 11<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/BB.489.P6.COM.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> and Wedgwood's catalogue of earthenware and porcelain, <sup<a>ill. 12<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/BB511.1.1.COM.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup>
      all probably at Flaxman's recommendation. For the most part, however, he remained in
      obscurity.</p>
  
    <h2><a name="1818" id="1818">7. John Linnell and the Final Years, 1818-1827</a></h2>

    <p>It was at this low point in his fortunes in 1818 that Blake first met John Linnell, the
      friend and patron who was to provide him with a circle of dedicated followers and a series of
      creative projects for the remaining years of his life. Linnell, then a twenty-six-year-old
      landscape painter, won Blake's friendship both by bringing him work&#8212;which he desperately
      needed&#8212;and by attempting to understand him on his own terms. "I never saw anything the least
      like madness," Linnell later recalled, "for I never opposed him spitefully as many did but
      being really anxious to fathom if possible the amount of truth which might be in his most
      startling assertions I generally met with a sufficiently rational explanation in the most
      really friendly &#38;conciliatory tone" (Bentley, <i>Blake Records</i> 257).</p>

    <p>Through Linnell, Blake met John Varley, a fellow artist and avid astrologer, and in 1819
      began sketching for him a series of <i>Visionary Heads</i>. Varley, who would later publish a
      <i>Treatise on Zodiacal Physiognomy</i> (1828), <sup><a>ill. 1<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/BB501.1.2.COM.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> took literally Blake's
      claim that these historical and imaginary figures appeared and sat for him, and he encouraged
      Blake to record their features. By 1825, Blake had sketched over 100 of them, including
      Solomon, <i>The Man who built the Pyramids</i>, Merlin the magician, <sup><a>ill. 2<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/BUT.757.PS.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> Edward
      I and William Wallace (king and revolutionary together on one sheet), <sup><a>ill. 3<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/BUT.734.PS.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> and
      <i>Harold Killed at the Battle of Hastings</i>. <sup><a>ill. 4<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/BUT.692.76.PS.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup>
      <i>Cancer</i>, <sup><a>ill. 5<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/BUT.692c.PS.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> an astrological sign associated with Blake's birth, may be in
      part a caricatured self-portrait. The vigorous musculature of <i>Old Parr When Young</i>
      <sup><a>ill. 6<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/BUT748.1.1.PD.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> might be interpreted as an embodiment of Blake's own artistic energies even
      into old age. The most famous visionary head, <i>The Ghost of a Flea</i>, was later engraved
      by Linnell and published in Varley's <i>Treatise on Zodiacal Physiognomy</i> (1828). <sup><a>ill.
        7<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/BB501.1.3.COM.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>Blake's professional relationship with Linnell's doctor, Robert John Thornton, was somewhat
      rockier. Linnell introduced the two in 1819, and soon afterward Blake produced four small
      designs in relief etching to illustrate the third edition of Thornton's school text of
      Virgil's <i>Pastorals</i> (1821). <sup><a>ill. 8<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/BB504.1.6-9.RE.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> Thornton apparently rejected these, for
      Blake soon set to work on preliminary drawings for execution in the more conventional medium
      of wood engraving. These engravings also disappointed Thornton, who decided to publish them
      only after hearing them praised by Linnell and other artists. <sup><a>ill. 9<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/BB504.1.6-9ESS.COM.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> Even then, he
      prefaced them with the disclaimer that they "display less of art than genius" (Bentley,
        <i>Blake Records</i> 271).</p>

    <p>Thornton may not have appreciated the rough simplicity of Blake's Virgil designs, but they
      were to have a profound influence on a younger generation of artists who also came to know
      Blake through Linnell. One of them, Samuel Palmer, called the engravings "visions of [. . .]
      Paradise; models of the exquisitest pitch of poetry" (Bentley, <i>Blake Records</i> 271). The
      group, which called itself "The Ancients," also included Edward Calvert, George Richmond,
      Frederick Tatham, and others. They referred to the two rooms at 3 Fountain Court in the
      Strand, where the Blakes lived from 1821, as "the House of the Interpreter," an allusion to a
      passage from Bunyan's <i>Pilgrim's Progress</i> that Blake had illustrated. Blake had moved
      there because of straitened finances, which also forced him to sell his collection of
      old-master prints that same year.</p>

    <p>Linnell was responsible for two major projects that occupied Blake's final years:
      illustrations to the <i>Book of Job</i>
      <sup><a>ill. 10<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/BB421.1.4.PS.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> and to Dante's <i>Divine Comedy</i>. Between 1823 and 1825, Blake engraved
      twenty-one designs based mainly on watercolor illustrations of <i>Job</i> that he had done
      earlier for Butts. In 1824, he commenced a series of 102 watercolor illustrations of Dante, a
      project cut short by his death in 1827. <sup><a>ill. 11<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/BUT812.1.1.WC.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup>
      <sup><a>ill. 12<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/BUT812.1.9.WC.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> According to Gilchrist, Blake, though in his late sixties, began studying
      Italian at this time in order to read Dante in the original (1: 334).</p>

    <p>In the final years of his life, Blake suffered from recurring bouts of an unknown disease
      that he called "that Sickness to which there is no name" (Erdman 781). The symptoms he
      described in his letters&#8212; "Shivring Fit[s]," "a gnawing Pain in the Stomach," "a deathly feel
      all over the limbs"&#8212;are consistent with biliary cirrhosis, which can be caused by prolonged
      exposure to the fumes produced when acid is applied to copper plates (Robson and Viscomi)&#8212;
      Blake's "infernal method" of etching his illuminated books "by corrosives, which in Hell are
      salutary and medicinal" (Erdman 39). In a letter to Linnell dated 3 July 1827, he mentioned a
      "relapse" brought on, he thought, by a trip to Hampstead: "I find I am not so well as I
      thought [. . .] I have been yellow accompanied by all the old Symptoms" (Erdman 785). Blake
      had visited Hampstead often since Linnell had moved there three years earlier, even though he
      considered the place unhealthy. "When I was young," he wrote to Linnell, "Hampstead Highgate
      Hornsea Muswell Hill &#38;even Islington &#38;all places North of London always laid me up the
      day after &#38;sometimes two or three days with precisely the same Complaint &#38;the same
      torment of the Stomach" (Erdman 775). Despite his symptoms, Blake expressed hopes of a quick
      recovery, but they proved unfounded. A little over a month later, on 12 August 1827, he died
      in his rooms at 3 Fountain Court.</p>

    <p>Even in the last stages of his illness, Blake continued to work. One of his final projects
      was a colored print of the frontispiece of <i>Europe</i> commissioned by Tatham, <i>Ancient of
        Days</i> copy F, on which he was reportedly at work just three days before his death
      (Bentley, <i>Blake Records</i> 109, 502). A set of watercolor illustrations to Bunyan's
        <i>Pilgrim's Progress</i> and an illuminated manuscript of <i>Genesis</i> were left
      unfinished. <sup><a>ill. 13<img src="https://www.blakearchive.org/figures/BUT828.1.2.WC.100.pre.jpg"/></a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>To the devoted circle of young artists who surrounded Blake in his final years, even his
      death seemed beautiful. He died "in a most glorious manner," Richmond wrote Palmer soon
      afterwards: "He said He was going to that Country he had all His life wished to see &
      expressed Himself Happy hoping for Salvation through Jesus Christ&#8212;Just before he died His
      Countenance became fair&#8212;His eyes brighten'd and He burst out in Singing of the things he Saw
      in Heaven" (Bentley, <i>Blake Records</i> 346-47).</p>

    <p>Blake was buried on 17 August 1827, with The Ancients in attendance (Bentley, <i>Blake
        Records</i> 22). In keeping with his own wishes as reported by Smith, he joined his parents,
      aunt, and brother in Bunhill Fields cemetery (Bentley, <i>Blake Records</i> 475-76).
      Obituaries tended to emphasize his personal quirks at the expense of his literary and artistic
      achievements. <i>The Literary Chronicle</i>, for example, described him as "one of those
      ingenious persons [. . .] whose eccentricities were still more remarkable than their
      professional abilities" (1 September 1827, qtd. in Bentley, <i>Blake Records</i> 351), a view
      that persisted until Gilchrist's <i>Life of William Blake, Pictor Ignotus</i> appeared in
      1863, finally securing his reputation as a major poet and artist.</p>

    <p>After Blake's death, Catherine lived first with Linnell in Cirencester Place, then, beginning
      in 1828, with Tatham until shortly before her death in 1831. She continued to sell Blake's
      works, most notably <i>The Characters in Spenser's Faerie Queene</i>, which brought a high
      enough price from the Earl of Egremont in 1829 to support her for the few years that remained.
      After her death, Blake's unsold works were left in the hands of Tatham, who reportedly
      destroyed many of them.</p>
