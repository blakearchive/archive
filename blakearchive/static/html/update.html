The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of <a href="exhibit/fakeblakes" target="_blank"><i>Fake Blakes</i></a>, a digital exhibition on illuminated books that were neither printed nor colored by William Blake but which were sold as lifetime copies and entered major Blake collections in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was curated by Joseph Viscomi and designed by Michael Fox with the assistance of Grant Glass. It joins the previously published installments in this wing: William Blake's Canterbury Pilgrims, Biography, Illuminated Printing, and Biblical Illustrations. Exhibitions can be accessed through the drop-down at the upper right of the Archive's home page.

The exhibition's first five of six galleries identify copies of illuminated books that were printed after Blake died in 1827, either by Catherine Blake or Frederick Tatham, Blake's follower who inherited the illuminated plates after Catherine died in October 1831. All of them were finished in water colors long after Catherine and Tatham died, either in the late 19th or early 20th century, and sold as lifetime copies. Geoffrey Keynes, in <i>A Bibliography of William Blake</i> (1921), assigned capital letters to illuminated books produced by Blake and lower case letters to books produced posthumously. As this exhibition demonstrates, he and many curators, collectors, and dealers were sometimes fooled, by these works and by the 19th century facsimiles in gallery six.
