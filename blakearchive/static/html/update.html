The William Blake Archive is pleased to present Blake's <i>Fall of Man</i> and five versions of his Last Judgment designs in our Works in Preview wing, an environment that enables viewers to enlarge images many times their true size to clarify details obscured in other reproductions. Works in Preview can be accessed through the drop-down at the upper right of the Archive's home page.

Writing of Blake’s death in 1827, J. T. Smith states that had Blake "fortunately lived till the next year's exhibition at Somerset-house, the public would then have been astonished at his exquisite finishing of a Fresco picture of the last Judgement, containing upwards of one thousand figures, many of them wonderfully conceived and grandly drawn." The painting, estimated at 7 x 5 feet and probably worked on over many years, is not extant, but it may be the design that Blake described in his <a href ="work/bb122">Notebook</a> (Objects 68-72, 76-82, 84-87, 90-93) about 1810, when he was contemplating another exhibition like the one of 1809. If so, then it was based on <i><a href="preview/but645?descId=but645.1.1.wd.01">The Last Judgment</a></i>, c. 1809, a finished pen and wash drawing once owned by Blake’s patron Thomas Butts, now in the National Gallery of Art. A <a href="preview/but646?descId=but646.1.1.pd.01">tracing</a> of this work is in the Essick Collection and is included here. Around the same time, Blake executed <i><a href="preview/but644?descId=but644.1.1.wd.01">The Last Judgment</a></i>, a rough pencil drawing of the same basic composition now in the Harry Ransom Center, University of Texas. The center's works by Blake can now be found among our Collection Lists in the Resources for Further Research section of the Archive.

<i><a href="preview/but639?descId=but639.1.1.wc.01">A Vision of the Last Judgement</a></i>, an earlier version of the subject, in pen and watercolor over pencil, dated 1806, is now in Pollok House, Glasgow. It is the companion to <i><a href="preview/but641r?descId=but641.1.1.wc.01">The Fall of Man</a></i>, a watercolor drawing, dated 1807, now in the Victoria and Albert Museum.  In 1807, the Countess of Egremont commissioned <i><a href="preview/but642r?descId=but642.1.1.wc.01">The Vision of the Last Judgment</a></i>, pen and watercolor over pencil, dated 1808, now in Petworth House, Sussex. Blake described this composition in detail in a <a href="copy/letters?descId=lt18jan1808.1.ltr.01">letter to Ozias Humphry</a>, 18 January 1808, which is reproduced in the Manuscripts section of the Archive. The earliest extant design of the subject was <i><a href="copy/butwba10.1?descId=butwba10.1.wc.12">The Day of Judgment</a></i>, executed in 1805 as a preliminary watercolor drawing for Robert Blair's <i>The Grave</i>, which was engraved by Louis Schiavonetti (see <a href="copy/bb435.1?descId=bb435.1.comdes.09">Object 9</a>).

In Preview mode, viewers zoom in or out by using the Preview window’s "plus" or "minus" buttons, by moving two fingers up or down on the track pad, or by using a mouse’s wheel; viewers move an image by clicking and dragging. Images can also be examined in Full Screen mode, which provides the largest display and is ideal for external monitors. Viewers return to the whole design as initially displayed by clicking Home; in Full Screen mode, they return by clicking Exit Full Screen. Both viewing modes are accompanied by a slider that lightens and darkens the image, enabling users to see details long obscured by darkened paints and varnishes. The medium, size, date, provenance, and location of each design is given in the Work Information link under the image; also accompanying each design are Editors’ Notes and a link to the Lightbox, where images can be moved, rotated, resized, and cropped.
