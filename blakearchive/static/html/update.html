The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of digital editions of Blake's <a href="work/s-inn" target="_blank"><i>Songs of Innocence</i> Copy D</a> from the Morgan Library and Museum, Copy O from the Harry Ransom Center, University of Texas, Copy Q from Syracuse University Library, and Copy S from the Cincinnati Art Museum. 
</p>
<p>
Blake first published <i>Innocence</i> with thirty-one Plates in 1789, the date on its title page. He appears to have printed twenty-three copies that year; three&#8212;possibly the first copies of <i>Innocence</i> printed&#8212;were in black ink on one side of the leaf, which remained uncolored (Copy U in the Archive is one of the three). Twenty were printed in green, yellow ochre, or raw sienna inks on both sides of octavo size leaves and finished in light watercolor washes. At least four of these were combined with copies of <i>Songs of Experience</i>, printed in 1794, to form <a href="work/s-inn" target="_blank"><i>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</i></a> (Copies B-E). For these newly combined copies, Blake moved Plates 34–36 (“The Little Girl Lost” and “The Little Girl Found”) to <i>Experience</i>, leaving <i>Innocence</i> with twenty-eight Plates. He moved Plates 53 (“The School Boy”) and 54 (“The Voice of the Ancient Bard”) to <i>Experience</i> in 1818.

<i>Innocence</i> Copy D, printed in 1789 in yellow ochre (with four Plates in light brown or raw sienna ink) on both sides of the leaves, has thirty-one Plates and is finished in light washes. Copy O, printed c. 1802 in raw sienna ink on one side of the leaves, has twenty-six impressions finished in light washes, pen and ink outlining, and page numbers in the upper right corner of the designs. Plates 6 and 7 (“The Ecchoing Green”), numbered 5 and 6 in this copy, were extracted and are not extant. Copy Q, printed c. 1804 in light orangish yellow ochre ink on one side of the leaves, has twenty-eight Plates and is finished in delicate washes, pen and ink outlining, and page numbers in pencil. The texts of Plates 17 and 19 (“A Cradle Song” and “Holy Thursday”) were lightly printed and entirely rewritten in pen and brown watercolor. The untrimmed leaves of Plates 2 and 5 (frontispiece and "The Shepherd") in Copy Q are included as supplementary images to show how the plates were originally registered to the paper. Copy S, mostly printed c. 1811 in light black ink on one side of the leaves, has twenty-eight Plates and is finished in light washes and pen and ink page numbers. Plate 2, the frontispiece printed in green ink, was added to Copy S between 1920 and 1922; Plates 3, 4, 12, and 27, printed in shades of brown ink, are also from earlier printings.

<p>
Of these four copies of <i>Innocence</i>, only Copy D has ever been reproduced, by William Muir in a colored lithographic facsimile in 1885; the other copies have never been reproduced. With these copies, the Archive continues to realize its objective of publishing exemplary copies of each illuminated book from each of its printings and expanding the Blake canon by presenting works previously not available for study by the general public. 
</p>
<p>
The Archive now contains fully searchable and scalable digital editions of 132 copies of Blake's nineteen illuminated books. Users may view color corrected digital images of Blake's works at their true size, and enlarge and rotate these images to examine texts and illustrations in detail. The images are accompanied by diplomatic transcriptions and editors' notes, as well as illustration descriptions that make it possible to search Blake's works for visual motifs. The Archive also provides full bibliographic and provenance information for each digital edition it publishes. 
</p>
<p>
As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with the University of Rochester, the continuing support of the Library of Congress, and the cooperation of the international array of libraries and museums that have generously given us permission to reproduce works from their collections in the Archive.
