The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of digital editions of <a href="copy/songsie.u" target="_blank" ><i>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</i> Copy U</a>, from Princeton University Library, and <a href="copy/songsie.w" target="_blank" >Copy W</a>, from King's College, Cambridge University. Both are late copies and join Copies A, B, C, E, F, L, N, R, T, V, Y, Z, and AA, already available in the Archive.
</p>
<p>
<i>Songs</i> Copy U was printed in orange ink, given orange frame lines and page numbers, and finished in watercolors and pen and ink. It was produced in the same style on the same Ruse & Turner paper as <i>Songs</i> Copy T, <i>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</i> Copy G, <i>The Book of Urizen</i> Copy G, <i>Visions of the Daughters of Albion</i> Copies O, N, and P, <i>The Book of Thel</i> Copies N and O, and <i>Milton</i> Copy D. This set of illuminated books—which, with the exception of <i>Visions</i> Copy N, are in the Archive—was produced in 1818 and represents Blake's return to illuminated printing. Except for a few copies of <i>Songs</i> and <i>Milton</i> between 1802 and 1811, Blake had not printed an illuminated book—or a group of them together—since 1795. </p>

These late copies of illuminated books are often referred to as "elaborately colored," but that fails to do them justice. The pages do not resemble lightly washed manuscripts or drawings, like the first copies (1789-93), or oil sketches, like color printed copies or books of designs (1794-96); nor do they resemble the hand-colored large paper copies of 1795. The pages are highly finished watercolor drawings. Blake printed the full plate (no wiping of borders) in bright reddish or orangish ink, finished the impressions in transparent and translucent washes and stippling brushwork, and carefully outlined texts and figures in pen and ink. The attention to detail was sustained throughout, and the designs often contain shell gold and were given a single thin red line or floral border to frame the image and thereby emphasize their autonomy as paintings in watercolor.

The renewal of Blake’s vigorous commitment to the illuminated books is evident in the ornate, beautifully colored impressions of <i>Songs</i> Copy W, printed in 1825 on large sheets of J Whatman 1825 paper (approximately 28 x 22 cm.) that give the small plates (approximately 11.5 x 7 cm.) wide margins that serve to frame the images. The untrimmed sheets for objects 1, 3, and 42 are shown as supplementary images.  As in <a href="copy/songsie.y" target="_blank" ><i>Songs</i> Copy Y</a>, its companion copy, each of the designs in Copy W is decoratively framed with vines, curtains, and other motifs drawn in green watercolor, probably by Catherine Blake, who described the copy as being "especially precious from having been ‘Blake’s own'" (Alexander Gilchrist, <i>Life of William Blake</i> [1863], 1:365). She sold it for £10.10 to John Jebb, Bishop of Limerick, in 1830. Like Copy U, the plates of Copy W are ordered 1 through 54, as they are in seven of the last eight copies printed (Copy V is the exception). Blake based this plate order—now considered standard for all print editions—with slight variations on <i>Songs</i> Copy R, printed in 1795 and his personal copy until he refinished it in 1819 for John Linnell, his new patron (see the 14 December 1999 Update for <a href="copy/songsie.r" target="_blank" ><i>Songs</i> Copy R</a>).
