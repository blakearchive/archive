The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of digital editions of Blake's <a href="work/vda" target="_blank"><i>Visions of the Daughters of Albion</i></a> Copies D and M from the Houghton Library, Copy K from the New York Public Library, and Copy L from Princeton University Library.
</p>
<p>
<i>Visions</i>, extant in eighteen complete copies, consists of eleven relief-etched plates executed and first printed in 1793. Blake initially printed <i>Visions</i> on both sides of six quarto-size leaves in a print run of eleven copies, in yellow ochre (as in Copy A), raw sienna (Copies B, C, and E), and green (Copies H, I, and J), and he finished the impressions in light watercolor washes. In 1794, in a complete departure from this early mode of producing illuminated books, Blake printed Copies R and F in thick colors from the plates’ shallows and surfaces on one side of large sheets of folio size paper to produce impressions resembling oil sketches or paintings rather than water color drawings. The following year, Blake printed Copy G in a brownish black ink and finished the impressions in somber colors, capturing the dark mood of the poem. Blake did not produce <i>Visions</i> again until 1818, when he printed Copies O and P in orangish red ink, with full plate borders, and finished the impressions in watercolors and pen and ink, adding a single frame line around each image, which presents the book pages as water color paintings. 
</p>

All of these copies are in the Blake Archive, as is Copy MPI, an abbreviation for Miscellaneous Plates and Impressions, which comprises an illuminated book’s proofs, impressions in different states, posthumous impressions, and lifetime impressions not used or extracted from copies. To these copies we now add the four copies that complete the history of the first print run of eleven copies. Copy D was printed in yellow ochre on large sheets of J. Whatman paper, approximately 38.1 x 27.2 cm.; Copies K, L, and M were printed in green ink on large sheets of E &amp; P paper, approximately 37.5 x 26 cm. Examples of the full leaf can be seen in "Supplemental Views" in the navigation bar below the images of Objects 1 and 10 of Copy D, Objects 7 and 11 of Copy K, Object 1 of Copy L, and Object 9 of Copy M. Most of these leaves have three stab holes along their edge, which the Blakes used to stitch leaves together to form a copy, and all the views show how well&#8212;or poorly&#8212;the plates are registered to the paper, which creates even or uneven margins and images that tilt, float, or fall on the page. Blake’s original plate registrations are not captured in reproductions, where, for economic and aesthetic reasons, the image is re-aligned to fit its page or, as in the Archive, its window.

Impressions from these copies can be compared with other impressions from the same plates using the "Objects from the Same Matrix" feature in the second navigation bar below the image. Users can there trace the history of the book’s production as well as compare printing and coloring styles of impressions; users will note that copies from the same printing sessions share color schemes and shapes—even across issues, that is, Copy D Object 7 was printed in yellow ochre ink but has the same finishing as Plate 7 in Copy K, which was printed in green ink. All extant copies of <i>Visions</i> are in the Archive except for Copy N, from 1818, which is in a private collection and unavailable for reproduction. Copies Q and S, possibly from c. 1795, are untraced.

All works in the Archive are accessible via the Table of Contents, which is accessible via the "sandwich" button at the right end of the banner. This drops down a second banner that identifies the categories of works in the Archive: Illuminated books, Commercial Book Illustrations, Separate Prints and Prints in Series, Drawings and Paintings, Manuscripts and Typographic Works. To further improve accessibility to the works, we've added a Table of Contents item, "All Works," which twice lists all of the works in the Archive without categorizing them according to genre or medium. One list puts the works in alphabetical order and the other in order of composition date. The latter list would of course be of interest to any Blake scholars mindful of the historical progression of Blake's works.

Users may view color corrected digital images of Blake's works at their true size, and enlarge and rotate these images to examine the text and illustrations in detail. The images are accompanied by diplomatic transcriptions and editors' notes, as well as illustration descriptions that make it possible to search Blake's works for visual motifs. The Archive also provides full bibliographic and provenance information for each digital edition it publishes. Though the Archive retains its focus on the material conditions of Blake's art, presenting images in the context of works and copies, it also contextualizes each work, copy, and object in a network of relations. In addition to comparing objects printed from the same matrix, users of the site can view each Blakean object alongside objects in the same copy, objects from the same production sequence, and objects with similar designs. This contextualization, which draws on the expertise of the Archive's editors, enables comparisons across time, medium, and genre, and foregrounds the immense variety and the recurring themes of Blake's art.

<p>
As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with the University of Rochester, the continuing support of the Library of Congress, and the cooperation of the international array of libraries and museums that have generously given us permission to reproduce works from their collections in the Archive.
