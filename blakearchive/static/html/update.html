The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of <a href="copy/america.mpi" target="_blank" >sixteen impressions of plates</a> for <i>America a Prophecy</i> not used in any copy of the poem, and a copperplate fragment.
</p>
<p>
These loose impressions form a new category of graphic works, referred to in the index of copies as "MPI," an abbreviation for Miscellaneous Plates and Impressions. As a group, MPIs reveal Blake's creative process as it unfolded through production, providing insights and new information about designs and texts. For example, Blake executed three plates that he rejected and did not use in any copy of <i>America</i>. They are designated Plates a, b, and c and are here displayed as Objects 6, 7, and 8. Plate a has the same text as Plate 5, with an added figure in flames holding a spear standing in the left margin. Plate b is a variant of Plate 6, with variants in design and text. Plate c is not a variant of any published plate and contains a unique text and designs. It may have been meant to be placed between Plates 10 and 11, or possibly after Plate b. Plate c includes complex pencil revisions by Blake. Plate d, another rejected plate, is already in the Archive under Separate Plates. It is known only because Blake used part of it to create "A Dream of Thiralatha," which he included in the <i>Large Book of Designs</i>.

Object 17 shows a fragment of the copperplate of Plate a, which is the only surviving fragment of one of Blake's copperplates etched in relief. The verso, Object 18, shows the head of a saint engraved by Thomas Butts, Jr., the son of Blake's patron, who was studying engraving with Blake c. 1806–1808.

Ten of the fourteen lifetime extant copies of <i>America</i> were printed in 1793 on both sides of leaves in bluish and greenish black inks and left uncolored. The impression of Plate 1, Object 4, from the Rosenbach Museum, was printed with these copies, in bluish black ink, but it was finished in black and light sepia washes, the only impression among the <i>America</i> MPIs that was colored. The three impressions of Plate 4, Objects 9, 10, 11, were also printed among these first copies, when Blake masked the last five lines so that they would not print. Object 15 is an impression of Plate 15 that was presumably not used because it was too lightly printed in olive brown.
</p>
<p>
Object 16 is another impression of Plate 15, but in reddish brown ink, as were impressions of Plates 1 and 10, Objects 3 and 12; all three impressions in reddish brown are posthumous, printed by Frederick Tatham, who printed <i>America</i> Copy P, c. 1832, which is in the Archive, in this color. 
</p>
<p>
<i>America</i> Copy MPI can be accessed like plates in copies of <i>America</i> and compared with impressions from the same copperplate using the "Objects from the Same Matrix" feature in the second navigation bar below the image. The Archive will gradually publish groups of miscellaneous plates and impressions for each illuminated book (some groups consisting of over forty impressions), which will enable users to trace the evolution of Blake's printed designs.
</p>
<p>
The Archive now contains fully searchable and scalable digital editions of 122 copies of Blake's nineteen illuminated books. Users may view color corrected digital images of Blake's works at their true size, and enlarge and rotate these images to examine texts and illustrations in detail. The images are accompanied by diplomatic transcriptions and editors' notes, as well as illustration descriptions that make it possible to search Blake's works for visual motifs. The Archive also provides full bibliographic and provenance information for each digital edition it publishes. 
</p>
<p>
As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access restrictions and charging no subscription fees.  The site is made possible by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with the University of Rochester, the continuing support of the Library of Congress, and the cooperation of the international array of libraries and museums that have generously given us permission to reproduce works from their collections in the Archive.
