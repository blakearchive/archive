The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of a digital edition of <a href="work/bb747" target="_blank">Blake's annotations to Dr. Robert John Thornton's <i>The Lord's Prayer</i></a>, 1827. With this work, the Archive inaugurates the "Annotated Works" sub-category within the Archive's category of Manuscripts and Typographic Works. This category has long been the purview of the late Morris Eaves and his editorial assistants at the University of Rochester, now under the supervision of Marcie Woehl.

When we think of annotations, we might think of the kind we make ourselves: quick notes to capture a reaction or thought provoked by the text at hand. These remarks are often unfiltered and, as such, quite reflective of their annotator. Blake's annotations are no different. He was a spirited and active reader; he underlined, he argued, he corrected, and he celebrated&mdash;frequently all in one work. It is through these varied expressions that we are given access to Blake's personality, thoughts, and impressions throughout the time period from which we have his annotations, roughly 1788-1827. Though it is not known how many works Blake may have annotated in his lifetime, eleven annotated texts are extant, and two other sets of annotations exist separate from the original texts.
</p>

Dr. Robert John Thornton's <i>The Lord's Prayer</i> is both the last work known to be annotated by Blake and the final work published by Thornton, who died destitute in 1837. Thornton was the personal physician to John Linnell, Blake's last patron and the person who probably introduced him to Blake around 1818. Thornton commissioned Blake to illustrate an "Imitation of Eclogue I" in his successful school text, <a href="work/bb504" target="_blank"><i>The Pastorals of Virgil</i></a>, 1821. Blake's wood engravings were unorthodox, technically and visually, and Thornton had to be persuaded by Linnell and other eminent artists to accept them. <i>The Lord’s Prayer</i>, however, would prove to be just as, if not more, divisive than Blake's unconventional wood engravings. Part new translation and part commentary, Thornton's "translation" modified the original Greek text to align better with his own conception of the work. As such, when Linnell presented Blake with a copy of Thornton's text&mdash;likely for the express purpose of being returned with annotations&mdash;Blake had much motivating him to write. Though the scorned wood engravings may have played a part in the hostility of his annotations, the translated prayer and accompanying "Critical and Explanatory Notes" were likely themselves the chief provocations, as much of "Doctor Thorntons Tory Translation" (Object 10) was quite categorically opposed to Blake's own worldview. "I look upon this as the Most Malignant & Artful attack upon the Kingdom of Jesus…", Blake declares in his first comment, arcing his bold opening salvo down the right-hand margin of the title page and, from there on, his criticisms, corrections, and at times, truly rancorous satire ("Lawful Bread Bought with Lawful Money &amp; a Lawful Heaven seen thro a Lawful Telescope….") will continue to the final page, culminating in a full parody of Thornton’s <i>Lord's Prayer</i>.
</p>
<p>
Though Blake left little ambiguity regarding his feelings towards Thornton's pamphlet, his annotations are not without a different kind of uncertainty. Predominantly written in pencil and then written over in ink, the annotations written only in pencil (perhaps too unclear to ink?)&mdash;such as those on Objects 6 and 10, in particular&mdash;are exceedingly difficult to read and have posed a challenge to all scholars to date seeking to represent them. Rigorously transcribed to reflect every deletion, addition, and uncertain text, the diplomatic transcription provided here creates a new digital resource for those interested in working with Blake's spirited, and at times near-illegible, writings.

In a letter to John Linnell, dated August 29, 1828, Samuel Palmer remarked that his father "would be very much amused by a sight of Mr. Blake's annotations to Dr. T.s [sic] Lord's Prayer" (Bentley, <i>Records</i>, 486), and, indeed, contemporary readers will find themselves in a similar state of amusement reading the annotations, which are very likely the last words Blake wrote on the subject of the Bible. Capturing his deeply-held views on religion, politics, and economics alike, we must join in echoing Blake's concluding statement of his parody, either in matching irony or diverging sincerity: "for all this we Thank Dr Thornton" (Object 10).
