The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of a digital edition of four miscellaneous manuscript poems. Three of these four scraps of Blake’s legacy may have disappeared permanently were it not for the remarkable energy and devotion of the Gilchrists and Rossettis in tracing and publicizing what was left of “William Blake” by the second half of the nineteenth century. Not until a century later, in the 1980s, did the previously unknown “The Phoenix to Mrs Butts” resurface. Amazing things do happen. 
</p>
<p>
Two prose poems, <a href="work/bb196" target="_blank">“then She bore Pale desire” and “Woe cried the muse,”</a> in seven pages on four leaves, are likely Blake’s earliest surviving manuscript drafts (c. 1783).  “then She bore Pale Desire” seems to begin in mid-course; whatever preceded the first line is missing. 
</p>
<p>
In both style and content they resemble other early works such as <a href="copy/bb128.c?descId=bb128.c.te.09" target="_blank">“Fair Elenor”</a> in <i>Poetical Sketches</i> (1783), relying heavily on popular late eighteenth century conventions such as the personification of abstractions—“Hate brooding in her Dismal den grew Pregnant & bore Scorn, & Slander” (“Pale Desire,” Object 5, lines 1-3)—alongside a few unmistakable anticipations of Blake’s later poetry, as in "the Nightly Blast that Blights the Infant Bud" ("Pale Desire," Object 7, lines 17-18). Compare <a href="copy/songsie.c?descId=songsie.c.illbk.49" target="_blank">“London,”</a> <i>Songs of Experience</i>: “How the youthful harlots curse / Blasts the new born infants tear” (lines 15-16, Erdman page 27).  
</p>
<p>
Four-beat couplets structure <a href="work/bb37" target="_blank">“A Fairy leapt.”</a> On the verso is a pencil sketch, <i>The Infant Hercules Throttling the Serpents</i>, though there is no obvious connection between the two. Fairies are not rare in Blake’s work.  “So sang a Fairy mocking as he sat on a streak’d Tulip / . . . My Fairy sat upon the table, and dictated EUROPE” (<i>Europe</i> Plate iii, Erdman page 60). They seem to be associated with something like mischievous, potentially disruptive knowledge. Blake’s fairies fall taxonomically between angels and devils, emerging from a dimension somehow separate from the ghost world of history, mostly human, that he readily sketched on command for his young artist friends in his later life (collected as the Visionary Heads).
</p>
<p>
More carefully crafted, <a href="work/bbwba1" target="_blank">“The Phoenix to Mrs Butts”</a>—the first Mrs. Butts—is designed in a manner reminiscent of Blake’s illuminated books, in this case close to the design of <a href="copy/songsie.c?descId=songsie.c.illbk.34" target="_blank">“A Little Girl Lost”</a> from <i>Songs of Innocence</i> (1789) but composed as a kind of letter, and delivered by hand rather than by post. Beyond that, little is known of the circumstances that produced “The Phoenix.” It echoes the lexical imagery, meter (in this case, again, four-beat couplets), subject matter, and graphic design of, say, the <i>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</i>—and, yet again, a fairy:
</p>
<p>
The Fairy to my bosom flew<br>
Weeping tears of morning dew<br>
I said: Thou foolish whimpring thing<br>
Is not that thy Fairy Ring . . . <br>
Seem a Child & be a Child<br>
And the Phoenix is beguild<br>
(“The Phoenix to Mrs Butts,” Object 1, lines 17-24)

All works in the Archive are accessible via its Table of Contents. Clicking on the "sandwich" button at the right end of the banner drops down a second banner that identifies the categories of works in the Archive: Illuminated Books, Commercial Book Illustrations, Separate Prints and Prints in Series, Drawings and Paintings, Manuscripts and Typographic Works. To further improve accessibility to the works, we've added a Table of Contents item, "All Works," which twice lists all works in the Archive without categorizing them according to genre or medium. One list puts the works in alphabetical order and the other in order of composition date. The latter list would of course be of interest to any Blake scholars mindful of the historical progression of Blake's works.

As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with the University of Rochester, the continuing support of the Library of Congress, and the cooperation of the international array of libraries and museums that have generously given us permission to reproduce works from their collections in the Archive.
