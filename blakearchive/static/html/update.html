The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of <i>A Selected Annotated Bibliography of William Blake and His Circle: A Guide to Further Research</i> by Wayne C. Ripley, with contributions by Fernando Castanedo, Hikari Sato, Hüseyin Alhas, and Vera Serdechnaia. The bibliography can be accessed through its link in the navigation bar just below the images on the Archive's home page.
</p>
<p>
For primary sources, the bibliography records in one location most of Blake's writings, including individual copies of the illuminated books and lists of the miscellaneous print impressions (MPI) not currently available in the Blake Archive. (Presently, this information is spread out over many different books, catalogues, and articles.) The bibliography either provides basic bibliographical information about a work or directs users to this information in the Blake Archive. Citations also include external links to a work's digitization in the Blake Archive and/or the work's holding institution and its entry in the holding institution's digital catalogue entry. It also provides a complete list of print facsimiles, reproductions, editions, and translations.
</p>
<p>
For secondary sources, the bibliography draws together both the most important older sources documented in G. E. Bentley, Jr.'s comprehensive standard bibliographies (<i>Blake Books</i>, <i>Blake Books Supplement</i>, and <i>Wiliam Blake and His Circle</i>) and the newer sources recorded in the annual checklist of scholarship published in <i>Blake: An Illustrated Quarterly</i> (from 2018 to 2025). For most sources, the bibliography provides full citations, new annotations, links to the sources themselves (when available), where a source is recorded in the standard bibliographies, and where a source was published elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
The bibliography is arranged by ten major categories, which are listed in a hierarchical table of contents provided in the left viewing pane:
</p>
<p>  
<b>I.	    Teaching William Blake
II.	    General Introductions, Handbooks, Glossaries, and Classic Studies
III.	Editions of Blake’s Writing
IV.	    Biographies
V.	    Bibliographies
VI.	    Catalogues
VII.	Studies of Blake Arranged by Subject
VIII.	Specific Works by Blake
IX.	    Collections of Essays on Blake Published Since 1957
X.	    Appendices</b> 
</p>
<p> 
Most of these categories have numerous subsections that are revealed by clicking the arrowhead icon. Many subsections include a "General Introduction" that lists sources useful to new researchers. Some subsections include "Useful Contextual Information" that lists sources that illuminate Blake's or the topic's background. 
</p>
<p> 
Internal links are given throughout the bibliography to direct users to related content, including the collection in which an essay appeared. Both internal and external links automatically open in a new tab. The categories and their subsections are fully described in the Organization section of the Introduction, but some of the material not obvious from the category header is described below. 
</p>
<p>  
<b>Biographies</b> includes primary and secondary materials on both William and Catherine Blake and members of Blake's Circle. Entries for members of Blake's Circle include enumerative bibliographies on their writings and catalogues, secondary texts on Blake and the figure or institution, and secondary texts on the figure or institution apart from Blake.
</p>
<p>  
<b>Catalogues</b> includes standard, collection, exhibition, and sale catalogues. The entry for Martin Butlin's catalogue raisonné, <i>The Paintings and Drawings of William Blake</i> (1981), is found here, and it includes a comprehensive list of the scholarship that record new paintings and drawings after the publication of Butlin's catalogue.   
</p>
<p> 
<b>Studies of Blake Arranged by Subject</b> includes 22 broad areas of frequent study. These include art; literature; and composite art; but also gender and sexuality; race, (post-) colonialism; music; religion; reception; collectors of Blake; and studies of Blake scholars and scholarship. Art, literature, and music include subsections listing work on Blake and individual artists, writers and publishers, and musicians.    
</p>
<p> 
<b>Specific Works by Blake</b> are arranged according to the categories of the Blake Archive. Each of these sections has a General Introduction and other introductory material related to the medium or genre. Studies are listed under each individual work. A list of known copies, impressions, or editions is provided after the studies, followed by digital and print facsimiles (shortened to "Digital" and "Print" in the headers), reproductions, editions, and translations. 
</p>
<p> 
Some of the <b>Illuminated Books</b> have additional subsections. <i>Milton</i>, for example, includes studies of the "Jerusalem Hymn," and <i>There is No Natural Religion</i> separates the real and bogus copies of the book into their own subsections. The General Studies under <i>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</i> include scholarship on multiple <i>Songs</i>, but studies of individual <i>Songs</i> can be found in the subsequent subsection that lists the <i>Songs</i> according to the arrangement in Erdman's <i>Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake</i>. Studies that consider paired <i>Innocence</i> and <i>Experience</i> poems (like the two versions of "The Chimney Sweeper") are listed with the <i>Experience</i> poem. There is also a section on the different electrotype facsimiles of Blake's copperplates for some of the <i>Songs</i>. 
</p>
<p> 
New impressions of the <b>Separate Prints or Prints in a Series</b> not recorded in Robert N. Essick's <i>The Separate Plates of William Blake: A Catalogue</i> (1983) are clearly specified, with a reference to the work of scholarship that discovered the new impression in a note.
</p>
<p> 
<b>Collections of Essays on Blake Published Since 1957</b> lists any collections with three or more essays on Blake. Books are arranged by the last name of the first editor, while journals are arranged by title. (If the editor of a collection that appeared in a journal is known, we have provided a link to the title under the editor's name.)  
</p>
<p>
The three <b>Appendices</b> include: a) the non-English sources recorded since <i>Blake</i> 2018, arranged by language; b) a list of the over 100 scholarly sources not previously recorded in the standard bibliographies; and c) useful and reliable websites related to Blake.
</p>
<p>
The full-text of the bibliography is also searchable. Clicking on a search result will navigate to that page in the bibliography in a new tab. To return to the list of search results, simply return to the original tab. Citations and annotations can also be copied and pasted by researchers compiling their own bibliography. 
</p>
<p>
The bibliography will be updated periodically in order to keep its sources and information current.
</p>
<p>
As with any resource this large, errors, dead-links, wrong-links, and other infelicities are inevitable. Oversights and corrections can be sent to Wayne C. Ripley (wripley@winona.edu). Ripley is also happy to share the pdf version of the bibliography upon request.
