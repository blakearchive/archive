The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of <a href="work/bb712" target="_blank">Blake’s annotations to Francis Bacon's <i>Essays: Moral, Economical, and Political</i></a>. The content of this second installment in our newest sub-category, "Annotations in Books," offers a unique window into not only Blake's unfiltered criticisms of Bacon but also his unfettered social, religious, and political ideals.  
</p>
<p>
The edition of the <i>Essays</i> that Blake owned was published in 1798, and Bentley surmises the annotations may have been written shortly thereafter (<i>Blake Books</i>, 682). The English political climate was still filled with paranoia towards those with varying degrees of antiestablishment sentiments, especially considering the looming threat of the Napoleonic Wars. While Blake wrote poetically in the 1790s about revolutionary ideas in works such as <a href="work/mhh" target="_blank"><i>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</i></a> and <a href="work/bb49" target="_blank"><i>The French Revolution</i></a>&mdash;the former issued unsigned and the latter dropped from publication by Joseph Johnson&mdash;we might speculate that he never imagined these bold annotations would be read by others at all. Just a handful of years later, Blake found himself, rather spuriously, on trial for sedition, thanks to his alleged retort about king and country to a loitering dragoon in his garden. Though he was acquitted, it goes to show that such confrontational words were taken seriously.  
</p>
<p>
Unlike his <a href="work/bb747" target="_blank">annotations to Thornton's <i>The Lord's Prayer</i></a>, which he originally made in pencil and traced over in ink (a preservation effort that suggests he anticipated at least his friends would read the notes), Blake's annotations to Bacon are written in pencil only, with some entries more indistinctly scrawled in the heat of judgment than others. The notes cover a large span of the book's content: ninety-one annotated pages are dispersed throughout the printed work, though pages without marginalia are not reproduced in our publication.  
</p>
<p>
In the right margin of page 55, Blake comically, if not bitingly, sketched a long chain that terminates at the phrase "A King" (Object 26). The top portion of the chain is now erased, but Bentley (<i>Writings</i> 2: 1430) and Erdman (<i>The Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake</i>, 624) suggest it was once a drawing of "the Devils arse," irreverently connecting kingship to rather unholy origins. Some pages later, in response to Bacon's governmental instructions to prevent sedition, Blake rails that "A Tyrant is the worst disease" and "the Cause Of all others" (Object 34). His wry sarcasm and indomitable spirit shine through the annotations here, which read like an uncensored debate between two fundamentally disparate thinkers. Whether Bacon's <i>Essays</i>  should be subject to such an appraisal is perhaps less interesting than noticing which ideas strike Blake as disingenuous.  
</p>
<p>  
Though Blake rarely mitigates his opinions, there is a particular freedom in these likely private annotations. This is a Blake who does not need to explain himself, which may have prompted Alexander Gilchrist's assessment that the annotations to Bacon are less insightful than others (<i>Life of William Blake</i> [1863], 1: 267). But these marginalia are valuable threads in the tapestry of Blakean thought. Through them, we can see Blake in striking contrast to an author who he imagined wrote with "contemptible villainy" (Object 20). Moreover, Blake's notes on the <i>Essays</i> are further enriched by the singular historical moment of the late 1790s. And as annotators often do, Blake claims a final word over Bacon, coolly qualifying the book by inserting the phrase "Good Advice for Satans Kingdom" after the printed title (Object 2).
