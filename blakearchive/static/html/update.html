<p>
The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of a Chaucer Omnibus, a selection of seven works by Blake on the subject of Geoffrey Chaucer. 
</p>
<p>
The Archive has previously published works by Blake that are of a Chaucerian nature; these include five pages in the <a href="work/bb122" target="_blank"><i>Notebook</i></a>, Objects 58, 67, and 119–21, in <b>Manuscripts and Typographic Works</b>, the tempera painting of <a href="work/but653" target="_blank"><i>Sir Jeffery Chaucer and the Nine and Twenty Pilgrims on their Journey to Canterbury</i></a>, in <b>Drawings and Paintings</b>, and all four states of the <a href="work/esxvi" target="_blank">engraving</a> of the painting, in <b>Separate Prints and Prints in Series</b>. Both the engraving and painting can also be viewed in a multi-gallery <a href="exhibit/canterburypilgrims" target="_blank">presentation</a> in <b>Archive Exhibitions</b>. The exhibition includes works in the Omnibus that are now also accessible in their genre categories:

</p>

<p>

	<p style="margin-left: 100px">
	<a href="work/bb12" target="_blank"><i>Blake’s Chaucer: The Canterbury Pilgrims</i></a>, 1809, a single page prospectus for the engraving of his painting, which he refers to as a "Fresco Picture."</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 100px">			
	<a href="work/bb11" target="_blank"><i>Blake's Chaucer: An Original Engraving</i></a>, 1810, an advertisement for and three-page leaflet describing the engraving.</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 100px">
	<a href="work/bb36" target="_blank"><i>Exhibition of Paintings in Fresco, Poetical and Historical Inventions</i></a>, 1809, an advertisement for Blake's exhibition with a one-page text on "The Invention of a portable Fresco," dated May 15, 1809 (in pen and ink). The sheet was folded to make an envelope addressed to "Ozias Humphry, Esq. / Sloan Street." Blake had enclosed "a ticket of admission" to his exhibition and a short letter asserting that "Florentine & Venetian Art cannot exist together," claims he expounds upon in the exhibition’s <i>Descriptive Catalogue</i>, which includes Blake's lengthy description of his Chaucer painting.</p>

<p>
These works are now available for study in <b>Manuscripts and Typographic Works</b>, as is the <a href="work/bb32" target="_blank"><i>Descriptive Catalogue</i></a>. 
</p>
<p>
Another work in the Archive's digital exhibition on Chaucer now accessible in its genre category of <b>Drawings and Paintings</b> is 
</p>	

<p>

	<p style="margin-left: 100px">
	<a href="work/but654r" target="_blank"><i>The Canterbury Pilgrims: Sketch for the Engraving</i></a>, 1809, a pencil drawing based on the painting but reducing its size to that of the engraving.</p>
<p>
The Omnibus also includes two works in <b>Commercial Book Illustrations</b>:
</p>
<p>

	<p style="margin-left: 100px">
	An engraving after a design by Stothard, dated March 1783, that served as the frontispiece to volume XIII of <a href="work/bb442" target="_blank"><i>The Poetical Works of Geoffrey Chaucer</i></a> in <i>Bell’s Edition [of] the Poets of Great Britain</i>.</p>
<p>

	<p style="margin-left: 100px">
	<a href="work/bb443" target="_blank"><i>The Prologue and Characters of Chaucer's Pilgrims Selected from his Canterbury Tales</i></a>, which comprises a frontispiece, dated Dec 26, 1811, and a tailpiece. The former reproduces, at a much reduced size, a portion of the left side of the large engraving; the latter is a vignette of Canterbury Cathedral.</p>
<p>
Also included in the Omnibus is a
</p>
<p>

	<p style="margin-left: 100px">
	<a href="work/bb443" target="_blank">portrait of Chaucer</a> from the series of <i>Eighteen Heads of Poets</i> that Blake painted in watercolor and pen and ink for William Hayley's library, c. 1800-1803, and now in the Manchester Art Gallery. It is the first of the series in the Archive (to be joined by the others in due course) and can be found under <b>Drawings and Paintings</b>.</p>
