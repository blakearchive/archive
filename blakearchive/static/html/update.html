The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of digital editions of three posthumous copies of <a href="work/america"><i>America a Prophecy</i></a>. Copies N and Q were printed by Catherine Blake, c. 1829, and are in the Auckland Public Library and Princeton University Library respectively. Copy P, in the Fitzwilliam Museum, was printed c. 1832 by Frederick Tatham, one of a group of young artists who befriended Blake at the end of his life, calling him the "Interpreter" and themselves the "Ancients." Tatham cared for Catherine Blake after Blake died in August 1827 and obtained all of Blake's effects, including the copperplates of Blake's illuminated books, after Catherine died in October 1831. The posthumous copies join <i>America</i> Copies A, B, E, F, M, and O, already in the Archive, and <a href="work/jerusalem"><i>Jerusalem</i></a> Copy I, a posthumous copy printed by Tatham c. 1832. </p>
<p> 
Posthumous copies of illuminated books (of <i><a href="work/songsie">Songs</a>, America, <a href="work/europe">Europe</i></a>, and <i>Jerusalem</i>) are part of Blake's reception history in the nineteenth century. They are also important bibliographically because they accurately reveal the copperplate designs and texts, usually more so than lifetime impressions, which were often printed without plate borders and finished in watercolors, with texts touched up and even altered in pen and ink.</p>
<p> 
<i>America a Prophecy</i>, dated 1793, was the first of Blake's "Continental Prophecies," followed by <i>Europe a Prophecy</i> in 1794, executed in the same style and size but usually colored, and, in 1795, "Africa" and "Asia," two sections making up <a href="work/s-los"><i>The Song of Los</i></a>. Fine and important examples of all three books are in the Archive. </p>
<p> 
Blake described <i>America</i> as folio in the 1793 <a href="work/bb206">Prospectus</a> and, along with <i>Europe</i>, in his 1818 <a href= "copy/letters?descId=lt9june1818.1.ltr.01">letter to Dawson Turner</a>. All lifetime copies were folio in size—approximately 37 x 27 cm., which are quarters of Imperial sheets—except <i>America</i> Copy O and <i>Europe</i> Copy K, the last copies that Blake printed, in 1821 for John Linnell, which are quarto in size, at 30 x 24 cm. Catherine Blake appears to have used these late copies as her model, printing <i>America</i> Copy Q and <i>Europe</i> Copy L as matching quartos, at 29.5 x 22.1 cm., on T. Stains wove paper dated 1813. She printed <i>America</i> Copy N and <i>Europe</i> Copy I as matching quartos, at 32.6 x 23.6 cm., on Ruse and Turners laid paper dated 1812. Tatham also paired the two books, printing <i>America</i> copy P with <i>Europe</i> Copy M as quartos, at 28 x 22.8 cm., on J. Whatman 1832 wove paper. </p> 
<p> 
<i>America</i> comprises eighteen major text and design plates and a small plate (e) bearing the word "Preludium" and printed above the design on Plate 3. Ten of the fourteen lifetime extant copies of <i>America</i> were printed in 1793 on both sides of leaves in bluish and greenish black inks and left uncolored. The last five lines of Plate 4 were masked and did not print, and Plate 13 was printed in its first of two states. She and Tatham printed Plate 4 unmasked, Plates 11 and 13 in their second (final) states, and did not print Plate e. They both printed on one side of the leaf and left the impressions uncolored, but the similarities end there. </p>
<p> 
Catherine Blake's impressions are closer in appearance and feel to Blake's impressions than Tatham's. She printed in black intaglio ink on dampened paper, resulting in reticulated surfaces and designs shrinking slightly smaller than the plates upon drying. Moreover, she touched up impressions in light washes and numbered them in the top right corner. These features are characteristic of Blake's practice and differentiate her books from <i>Jerusalem</i> Copies H, I, and J; <i>America</i> Copy P; <i>Europe</i> Copy M; <i>Songs</i> Copies a, b, c, d, e, g, h, i, j, and p, and loose impressions; and Innocence Copy T—that is, from all the books printed on J. Whatman 1831 and 1832 papers by Tatham. He printed on dry paper in relief ink, usually sepia (a brownish red), a hue never used by Blake, and occasionally black, which transferred without reticulating. He did not touch up impressions or number them. Catherine Blake no doubt knew how Blake printed illuminated books from having assisted him in their production.</p>
<p> 
<i>America</i> Copy Q, though initially uncolored, is now colored because Walter T. Spencer, who acquired it and <i>Europe</i> Copy L between 1913 and 1918, had them colored before selling them as Blake’s printing and coloring. <i>America</i> Copy Q’s coloring was modeled on William Muir’s 1887 lithographic facsimile of <i>America</i> Copy A and went undetected as posthumous until it was exhibited in Philadelphia in 1939. The status of the coloring was confirmed by Geoffrey Keynes and Edwin Wolf in their 1953 Census. They also confirmed that <i>Europe</i> Copy L was posthumously colored, but they did not report posthumous printing for either book. That possibility was first suggested by G. E. Bentley, Jr., in his 1977 <i>Blake Books</i> and, for <i>Europe</i> Copy L, confirmed by Robert N. Essick in his 1985 catalogue of the Huntington collection. The identity of Catherine Blake as printer of <i>America</i> Copies N and Q as well as <i>Europe</i> Copies I and L is demonstrated in Joseph Viscomi’s “Posthumous Blake: The Roles of Catherine Blake, C. H. Tatham, and Frederick Tatham in Blake’s Afterlife” (<i>Blake/An Illustrated Quarterly</i>, vol. 53. no. 3, Fall 2019).  </p>
