<p>The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the
publication of a digital edition of <a href="work/but829">Blake’s twenty-nine water color
illustrations to John Bunyan’s <i>The
Pilgrim’s Progress</i></a>. We are grateful
to Alan Parker for permission to reproduce twenty-eight of these works from his
private collection. One design, <i>Christian with the Shield of Faith, Taking
Leave of His Companions</i> (Object 20), is in the National Gallery of Art,
Washington.</p>



<p>It’s not surprising that Blake would illustrate <i>The Pilgrim’s Progress</i>, second only to
the Bible as the most read book in Britain and America in Blake’s time, but
it’s difficult to determine his motivation for taking on the project and the
designs raise several questions that are hard to answer. Part one of Bunyan’s allegorical tale was
described on the title page as “the similitude of a dream” when first published
in 1678. Blake began work on his
illustrations no earlier than 1824 and left them unfinished upon his death in August
1827.</p>


<p>In the last four years of his life, Blake was busy with
several major projects, including the final stages of engraving his twenty-two
illustrations to the Book of Job, the 102 water color and seven engraved
illustrations to Dante’s <i>Divine Comedy</i>,
an illustrated manuscript of Genesis, and the printing and detailed colored of
five copies of <i>Songs of Innocence and of
Experience</i> with a total of 270 plates. In light of these undertakings and Blake’s increasing bouts of illness,
it is difficult to believe that he would further burden himself with the task
of illustrating <i>The Pilgrim’s Progress</i>
on speculation—that is, without a commission but in the hope of finding a
purchaser. John Linnell, who
commissioned the Job and Dante projects, would seem to be a logical candidate,
but there is no record of his involvement. Object 20, <i>Christian with the
Shield of Faith, Taking Leave of His Companions</i>, was acquired, possibly as
early as 1827, by Elizabeth (Mrs. Charles) Aders, a friend of Linnell’s who met
Blake no later than August 1825 and in December acquired from him <i>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</i> Copy
AA. She may have commissioned the entire
<i>Pilgrim’s Progress</i> group but kept
only one of the few designs with fine, albeit incomplete, coloring by Blake. Aders apparently rejected the remaining designs
or returned them to Blake’s widow, Catherine, because of their unfinished
condition. The first written reference
to the existence of the Bunyan designs, lacking only the one retained by Aders,
is in the catalogue of Sotheby’s auction of 29 April 1862, lot 187, “a series
of twenty-eight designs for The Pilgrim’s Progress.” The large number of works by Blake in this
sale, offered anonymously “from the cabinet of an amateur” and possibly other
vendors, were once in Frederick Tatham’s possession, although with an
intervening collector and/or dealer. Tatham
acquired Blake’s works remaining in his estate by inheritance or gift in 1831
from Catherine Blake. Thus it seems
probable that either the Bunyan water colors were executed without a patron or
they are the product of a commission from Aders never completed.</p>



<p>William Michael Rossetti, in his catalogue of Blake’s works
published in the 1863 edition of Alexander Gilchrist’s <i>Life of William Blake</i>, claimed that the Bunyan designs were “much
injured by the handiwork of Mrs. Blake, the colour being untidy-looking and
heavy for the most part, and crude where strength is intended. Two of the designs, at any rate, may be considered
untouched by Mrs. Blake” (volume 2, page 235). Subsequent scholars have taken a less harsh view of the coloring, but
most have accepted the idea that Catherine Blake, probably after her husband’s
death, tinted many of the designs or at least substantially augmented coloring already
executed by him. Attributions of the
coloring of each design are briefly noted in Martin Butlin, <i>The Paintings and Drawings of William Blake</i>,
nos. 829.1-29. In our introductory essay
and Editors’ Notes to each object we quote or summarize Butlin’s comments and
add our own attributions of the coloring for each object.</p>



<p>Blake produced one further illustration to <i>The Pilgrim’s Progress</i>, a white-line
etching titled <i>The Man Sweeping the
Interpreter’s Parlour</i>, based on a famous passage contrasting the harsh laws
of the Old Testament to the salvific forgiveness of the New. The print probably dates from c. 1822 and
thus at about the same time that the circle of young artists, including Samuel
Palmer and George Richmond, who gathered around Blake in his final years began
to refer to his dwelling as “the house of the Interpreter,” clearly an allusion
to Bunyan’s text and possibly to the print as well. In “A Vision of the Last Judgment” that he
wrote in his Notebook c. 1810, Blake comments as follows on <i>The Pilgrim’s Progress</i>: “Note here that
Fable or Allegory is Seldom without some Vision Pilgrims Progress is full of
it…” (Erdman page 554). Perhaps Blake intended
his illustrations to expand the viewer’s mental state and thereby perceive the
imaginative “Vision” within Bunyan’s allegory, the “dream” within the
“similitude.”
