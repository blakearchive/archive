The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of <a href="copy/europe.mpi" target="_blank" >forty-one proofs, impressions in different states, posthumous impressions, and lifetime impressions</a> of <i>Europe a Prophecy</i>. 
</p>
<p>
These loose impressions are referred to in the index of copies as "MPI," an abbreviation for Miscellaneous Plates and Impressions. As a group, MPIs reveal Blake's creative process as it unfolded through production, providing insights and new information about designs and texts.  For example, six plates are in early states not used in published copies. Object 16 is an impression of Plate 5 in the first of two states; Objects 13, 22, and 38 are impressions of Plates 4, 9, and 17 in the first of three states; and Objects 39 and 40 are impressions of Plates 17 and 18 in the second of three states. Objects 10 and 11, impressions of Plate 2, have major motifs added by Blake in pencil, pen and ink, and gray washes. Object 5, an impression of Plate 1, the frontispiece of the "Ancient of Days," is from the Whitworth Gallery and is in Blake’s late coloring style. Object 4, an impression of Plate 1, was printed by Blake but colored by an unknown hand. The same is true of Objects 19 and 20, impressions of Plates 6 and 7, which were trimmed of most of their texts, as were Objects 12, 18, and 21, impressions of Plates 4, 6, and 7.

Object 1, another impression of Plate 1, was lightly color printed by Blake; the colorist of the black wash forming the clouds, however, is questionable. Object 12, an impression of Plate 4, was color printed. Object 29, an impression of Plate 11, was heavily color printed, probably as the first pull of the plate color printed for <i>Europe</i> copy B, which is in the Archive. Objects 25 and 32, impressions of Plates 10 and 12, were lightly color printed, with the latter finished in delicate washes. Objects 14, 17, 23, and 41, impressions of Plates 4, 5, 9, and 18, are posthumous, printed by Frederick Tatham, who printed <i>Europe</i> Copy M, c. 1832, which is in the Archive, in this reddish brown color.

<p>
<i>Europe</i> Copy MPI can be accessed like plates in copies of <i>Europe</i> and compared with impressions from the same copperplate using the "Objects from the Same Matrix" feature in the second navigation bar below the image. The Archive will gradually publish groups of miscellaneous plates and impressions for each illuminated book, which will enable users to trace the evolution of Blake's printed designs.
</p>
<p>
The Archive now contains fully searchable and scalable digital editions of 123 copies of Blake's nineteen illuminated books. Users may view color corrected digital images of Blake's works at their true size, and enlarge and rotate these images to examine texts and illustrations in detail. The images are accompanied by diplomatic transcriptions and editors' notes, as well as illustration descriptions that make it possible to search Blake's works for visual motifs. The Archive also provides full bibliographic and provenance information for each digital edition it publishes. 
</p>
<p>
As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access restrictions and charging no subscription fees.  The site is made possible by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with the University of Rochester, the continuing support of the Library of Congress, and the cooperation of the international array of libraries and museums that have generously given us permission to reproduce works from their collections in the Archive.
