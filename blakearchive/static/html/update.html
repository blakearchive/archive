The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of digital editions of three posthumous copies of <a href="work/europe"><i>Europe a Prophecy</i></a>. Copies I and L were printed by Catherine Blake, c. 1829, and Copy M was printed by Frederick Tatham, c. 1832. Copy I is in the Auckland Public Library; Copy L is in the Huntington Library; and Copy M is in the Fitzwilliam Museum. They join <i>Europe</i> Copies A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and K, already in the Archive, and posthumous <a href="work/america"><i>America a Prophecy</i> Copies N and Q printed by Catherine Blake c. 1829, and posthumous <i>America</i> Copy P and <a href="work/jerusalem"><i>Jerusalem</i></a> Copy I printed by Tatham c. 1832.

Posthumous copies of illuminated books (of <a href="work/songsie"><i>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</i></a>, <i>America</i>, <i>Europe</i>, and <i>Jerusalem</i>) are part of Blake's reception history in the nineteenth century. They are also important bibliographically because they accurately reveal the copperplate designs and texts, usually more so than lifetime impressions, which were often printed with plate borders erased and finished in watercolors, with texts touched up and even altered in pen and ink.

<i>Europe</i>, dated 1794, is the second of Blake's "Continental Prophecies," following <i>America</i> of 1793 and preceding "Africa" and "Asia," the two sections of <a href="work/s-los"><i>The Song of Los</i></a>, of 1795. <i>Europe</i> presents in mythopoeic form the conflict between liberty and tyranny, the fundamental philosophical issues of Blake's revolutionary era. Historical events are reconfigured into their universalized representations through Blake's own cast of characters, including Enitharmon, the female personification of fallen nature and history, Orc, the spirit of revolt, and Los and Urizen, the "Eternals" who would become central to Blake's mythic system of the "Zoas." These contending forces lead beyond political revolution to an apocalypse of biblical scope.

Blake etched <i>Europe</i>'s eighteen plates in relief, with considerable white-line work in some designs, on the versos of <i>America</i>'s eighteen plates. The posthumous copies are missing Plate 3, a whimsical prefatory statement—present only in Copies H and K—about a "Fairy [who] sat upon the table, and dictated <i>Europe</i>." Blake paired <i>Europe</i> and <i>America</i> but did not print them together until 1821, when he produced <a href="copy/europe.k?descId=europe.k.illbk.01"><i>Europe</i></a> Copy K and <a href="copy/america.o?descId=america.o.illbk.01"><i>America</i></a> Copy O for John Linnell (see <a href="staticpage/update?p=update-0103"> update March 2001</a>). Blake described <i>Europe</i> and <i>America</i> as folio in his 1818 <a href="copy/letters?descId=lt9june1818.1.ltr.01">letter to Dawson Turner</a> (E 771). All lifetime copies were folio in size—approximately 37 x 27 cm., which are quarters of Imperial sheets—except Linnell’s copies, which are quarto in size, at 30 x 24 cm. Catherine Blake appears to have used these late copies as her model, printing <i>Europe</i> Copy L and <i>America</i> Copy Q as matching quartos, at 29.5 x 22.1 cm., on T. Stains wove paper dated 1813. She printed <i>Europe</i> Copy I and <i>America</i> Copy N as matching quartos, at 32.4 x 23.6 cm., on Ruse and Turners laid paper dated 1812. Tatham also paired the two books, printing <i>Europe</i> Copy M and <i>America</i> Copy P as quartos, at 28 x 22.8 cm., on J. Whatman wove paper dated 1832.  Catherine modeled the plate order of <i>Europe</i> Copy L and, with one variant, Copy I on Copy K (Plates 1- 5, 10-9, 6-8, 11-18). Tatham used an earlier copy as his model, ordering the plates 1, 2, 4-18.

Catherine Blake's impressions are closer in appearance and feel to Blake's impressions than Tatham's. She printed in black intaglio ink on dampened paper, resulting in reticulated surfaces and designs shrinking slightly smaller than the plates upon drying. Moreover, she touched up impressions in light washes and numbered them in the top right corner. These features are characteristic of Blake's practice and differentiate her work from <i>Jerusalem</i> Copies H, I, and J; <i>America</i> Copy P; <i>Europe</i> Copy M; <i>Songs</i> Copies a, b, c, d, e, g, h, i, j, and p, and loose impressions; and <i>Innocence</i> Copy T—that is, from all the books printed on J. Whatman 1831 and 1832 papers by Tatham. He printed on dry paper in relief ink, usually sepia (a brownish red), a hue never used by Blake, and occasionally black, which transferred without reticulating. He did not touch up impressions or number them. Catherine Blake no doubt knew how Blake printed illuminated books from having assisted him in their production.

<i>Europe</i> Copy L, though initially uncolored, is now colored because Walter T. Spencer, who acquired it and <i>America</i> Copy Q between 1913 and 1918, had them colored before selling them as Blake's printing and coloring. <i>Europe</i> Copy L’s coloring was modeled on William Muir’s facsimile of <i>Europe</i> Copy A and went undetected as posthumous until Geoffrey Keynes and Edwin Wolf recognized it as such in their 1953 <i>Census</i>. However, they did not report posthumous printing for <i>Europe</i> Copy L or <i>America</i> Copy Q, a possibility first suggested by G. E. Bentley, Jr., in his 1977 <i>Blake Books</i> and, for <i>Europe</i> Copy L, confirmed by Robert N. Essick in his 1985 catalogue of the Huntington collection. The identity of Catherine Blake as printer of <i>Europe</i> Copies I and L as well as <i>America</i> Copies N and Q is demonstrated in Joseph Viscomi's "Posthumous Blake: The Roles of Catherine Blake, C. H. Tatham, and Frederick Tatham in Blake's Afterlife" (<i>Blake/An Illustrated Quarterly</i>, vol. 53. no. 3, Fall, 2019).

With the addition of Copies I, L, and M, the Archive has now published all extant lifetime and posthumous impressions of <i>Europe</i>. The Archive has also published all extant copies of <a href="work/aro"><i>All Religions are One</i></a>, <a href="work/nnr"><i>There is No Natural Religion</i></a>, <a href="work/mhh"><i>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</i></a>, <a href="work/s-los"><i>The Song of Los</i></a>, <a href="work/b-los"><i>The Book of Los</i></a>, <a href="work/ahania"><i>The Book of Ahania</i></a>, and <a href="work/milton"><i>Milton</i></a>, and nearly all extant copies of <a href="work/urizen"><i>The Book of Urizen</i></a>, <a href="work/vda"><i>Visions of the Daughters of Albion</i></a>, and <a href="work/thel"><i>The Book of Thel</i></a>. Like all illuminated books in the Archive, the text and images of <i>Europe</i> Copies I, L, and M are fully searchable. New protocols for transcription, which produce improved accuracy and fuller documentation in editors’ notes, have been applied to these copies and to all the <i>Europe</i> texts previously published.
