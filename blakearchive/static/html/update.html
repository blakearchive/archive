The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of a digital edition of <a href="work/gates-child" target="_blank"><i>For Children: The Gates of Paradise</i> Copy A</a>, from the Rosenwald Collection, Library of Congress. In 1793, Blake etched and published <i>For Children</i>, an emblem book comprising eighteen small intaglio plates. Through a numbered series of designs with inscriptions ranging from single words to brief aphorisms, Blake puts the course of human life in psychological perspective. Some of the emblems form narrative sequences; others exemplify mental states and their reification in the external world. Though the first of five copies printed in 1793, Copy A is unique in that all of its 18 plates are in their first states, whereas the other copies printed in 1793, including Copy D, which is in the Archive, are in their second states.

Copy A is a proof copy, that is, it was printed to proof the designs and prepare them for the subsequent copies. It also joins <a href="work/gates-sexes" target="_blank"><i>For the Sexes: The Gates of Paradise</i></a> Copies B, D, F, and K, already in the Archive. <i>For the Sexes</i> is the revised version of <i>For Children</i>, augmented with three new plates, 19, 20, and 21. Copy B was printed c. 1818 with all but one of its first 18 plates in their third state; Copy D was printed c. 1825 with all but two of its first 18 plates in their fourth state; Copy K was printed c. 1826–27 with nearly all the core plates in their fifth and final state; Copy F, with all plates in their final states, was one of four copies posthumously printed by Catherine Blake, c. 1828–29.

With this publication of <i>For Children: The Gates of Paradise</i> Copy A, combined with our earlier publications of Copy D of <i>For Children</i> and four copies of <i>For the Sexes</i>, the Archive now presents all known states of all the plates Blake used for both works. Thus, the Archive enables students of Blake, using our compare feature (Objects from the Same Matrix) located below the image, to trace the evolution of every design from its first and second states in 1793 through Blake's revisions in c. 1818, 1825, and c. 1826-27. The original plate numbers etched lower left corner below the designs were erased and repositioned in the plate's second state, which included an imprint, "Publishd by WBlake 17 May 1793" or a variant thereof, sometimes including the name of Blake's London neighborhood, "Lambeth." The second state of Plate 2, the title plate, reads "Published by W Blake No 13 Hercules Buildings Lambeth and J. Johnson St. Pauls' Church Yard." In Copy A the title page is a proof that bears fragments of an erased imprint that may refer to J. Dodsley as the publisher or co-publisher. There is no other evidence that either Johnson (a bookseller for whom Blake executed many engravings) or Dodsley actually participated in the publication of the book. Johnson, however, may have been involved in selling, or at least displaying copies, of the book, for in a letter of 25 Sept. 1794 to Francis Douce, Richard Twiss states that "Blakes Paradise…. You will see" along with "several more of Blakes books" at "Johnsons" (Bentley, <i>Records</i>, page 65).
