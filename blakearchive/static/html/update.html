The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of a digital edition of Blake’s <a href="work/europe" target="_blank"><i>Europe a Prophecy</i> Copy a</a> from the British Museum.  
</p>
<p>
In Blake studies, lower case letters usually designate copies that were posthumously printed. In this case, however, the letter designates a proof copy printed while <i>Europe</i> was in progress. Blake first printed the eighteen plates of <i>Europe</i> in 1794. Nine complete copies are extant, though only copies H and K contain Plate 3, a whimsical prefatory statement about the poem’s origin. All of these copies are in the Archive. To these we now add Copy a, which completes the known printing history of <i>Europe</i>.  
</p>
<p>
Copy a comprises eleven proof impressions that appear to have been collated by Blake or Catherine Blake because the leaves were stabbed through five holes in the manner of other illuminated books. It was never issued by Blake; its earliest known owner was John Giles, cousin of Samuel Palmer, one of the followers of Blake who called themselves the “Ancients.” Nine of the impressions in Copy a are in early states of the design not used in published copies, and six of these are the only recorded impression of the design’s first or second state. For example, Object 1, an impression of Plate 1, “The Ancient of Days,” is the only recorded impression of the first state (of two). An abraded area above the figure's back suggests that some lines, perhaps picturing his upper right arm drawn back, were removed. Objects 6, 8, and 9&#8212;impressions of Plates 7, 10, and 11&#8212;are also the only recorded impressions of the plates’ first of two states. Object 11 is an impression of Plate 18, the only recorded impression of its first of three states. Object 7, an impression of Plate 9, is the only recorded impression of the design’s second of three states. The impressions were printed in bluish black and greenish black inks on wove and laid papers ranging between 33.0 x 23.4 cm. and 33.5 x 26.7 cm., with pen and black ink lines strengthening the outlines of several motifs in Object 11.

<p>
Copy a lacks Plates 3, 8, 12-16; its Plate 17 is printed on the verso of Plate 11, raising the possibility that Copy a may be an early version of <i>Europe</i> before the missing plates were etched. Andrew Lincoln suggests as much in "Blake's <i>Europe</i>: An Early Version?," <i>Notes and Queries</i>, n.s. 25.3 (June 1978): 213. For further discussion of the early sequence of plates, see Alexander S. Gourlay, "Philip D. Sherman's Blakes at Brown University," <i>Blake/An Illustrated Quarterly</i>, 28.3 (Winter 1994–95): 94-99. What earlier editors and bibliographers refer to as Copies b and c are gatherings of miscellaneous impressions and not true copies. These impressions from various collections have been brought together in the Archive as <i>Europe</i> Copy MPI, an abbreviation for Miscellaneous Plates and Impressions. Like Copy MPI, Copy a reveals Blake's creative process as it unfolded through production, providing insights and new information about designs and texts. 
</p>
<p>
The Archive now contains fully searchable and scalable digital editions of 128 copies of Blake's nineteen illuminated books. Users may view color corrected digital images of Blake's works at their true size, and enlarge and rotate these images to examine texts and illustrations in detail. The images are accompanied by diplomatic transcriptions and editors' notes, as well as illustration descriptions that make it possible to search Blake's works for visual motifs. The Archive also provides full bibliographic and provenance information for each digital edition it publishes. 
</p>
<p>
As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with the University of Rochester, the continuing support of the Library of Congress, and the cooperation of the international array of libraries and museums that have generously given us permission to reproduce works from their collections in the Archive.
