The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of a digital edition of Blake’s <a href="work/but343" target="_blank"><i>Eighteen Heads of Poets</i></a>. These tempera paintings, produced by Blake between c. 1800 and 1803, were commissioned by William Hayley as decorations for his upper library at Turret House, his residence in Felpham, Sussex. In addition, we are publishing an exhibition, titled <a href="exhibit/absorbedbythepoets" target="_blank">"Absorbed by the Poets,"</a> curated by Mark Crosby that reconstructs Turret House and the upper library to show how Blake’s paintings were sequenced and hung.
</p>

Blake had at least begun preliminary work on the <i>Heads of Poets</i> by the fall of 1800, as indicated by his letter to Hayley of 26 November: "Absorbed by the poets Milton, Homer, Camoens, Ercilla, Ariosto, and Spenser, whose physiognomies have been my delightful study…" (Erdman page 714). The sizes of the canvas panels, approximately 40.5 cm high and of varying widths, were determined by their intended setting as a frieze between the bookcases and ceiling. The choice of authors to portray rested with Hayley.

In most of the eighteen paintings in the group, Blake included, right and left of the central portrait, either characters or events presented in the writer's works or emblematic motifs that allude to those works. The introductory essay and the Editors’ Notes to each painting indicate the probable sources for the portraits and the literary and pictorial references of the side motifs.

As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with the University of Rochester, the continuing support of the Library of Congress, and the cooperation of the international array of libraries and museums that have generously given us permission to reproduce works from their collections in the Archive.
