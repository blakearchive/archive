      <p>
      29 August 2005
      
      <p>The William Blake Archive <!--www.blakearchive.org--> is pleased to announce that
        
        <p>-- The Archive has been designated an Approved Edition by the Modern
          Language Association.  This is the first time the organization has awarded
          its "seal" to an electronic edition.  The MLA's Committee on Scholarly
          Editions has been fostering rigorous editorial standards for printed
          editions since 1976.  David V. Erdman's <i>Complete Poetry and Prose of
            William Blake</i> received the MLA seal in 1981.  The Committee's guidelines
          for electronic editions were first published in 2004 as part of a major
          revision of the Committee's editorial guidelines
          (<a href="http://www.mla.org/cse_guidelines">http://www.mla.org/cse_guidelines</a>; see also Burnard, O'Keefe, and Unsworth,
          <i>Electronic Textual Editing</i>, MLA/TEI, forthcoming 2006).  Previously, the
          Archive was the recipient of the MLA's Prize for a Distinguished Scholarly
          Edition, 2003.
          
          <p>-- The British Library has agreed to allow us to publish scholarly editions
            of its Blake manuscripts.  The Library's Blake holdings include some of his
            most significant extant manuscripts, including the early illustrated poem
            <i>Tiriel</i>; the notebook in which he drafted poetry, prose, and designs for
            several decades; and <i>The Four Zoas</i>, the key "prophetic" work of his middle
            years, on which he worked for about a decade.  For the Blake holdings of this and other contributors,

            <p>As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible through the continuing support of the Library of Congress, the Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities at the University of Virginia, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and by the cooperation of the international array of libraries and museums that have generously given us permission to reproduce works from their collections in the Archive.
