      <p>22 April 2004</p>
      
      
      <p>The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of the
        electronic edition of <i>Europe a Prophecy</i> copy H. The only monochrome
        copy of the nine extant copies printed by Blake, copy H was printed c. 1795.
        Now in the Houghton Library, Harvard University, it joins copies B, E, and K
        in the Archive and will be joined by copies A and D in the near future.
        <i>Europe</i> is dated 1794 on its title plate and the first six copies were
        color printed that year, followed in 1795 by two more copies. Copies B and E
        are from the first printing session and copy K is from the last printing
        session, c. 1818. With the addition of copy H, the printing history of
        <i>Europe</i> is fully represented in the Archive.</p>
      
      
      <p>As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access
        restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible
        through the continuing support of the Library of Congress, the Institute for
        Advanced Technology in the Humanities at the University of Virginia, by a
        major grant from the Preservation and Access Division of the National
        Endowment for the Humanities, by the University of North Carolina at Chapel
        Hill, and by the cooperation of the international array of libraries and
        museums that have generously given us permission to reproduce works from
        their collections in the Archive.</p>
