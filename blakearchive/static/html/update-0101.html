      <!--<h2 class="title">William Blake Archive Update</h2>-->
      <p>15 January 2001</p>
      
      
      <p>The editors and staff of the William Blake Archive are very pleased to
        announce the public release of our next generation site design, dubbed "WBA
        2.0." Over a year in development, this is the first major revision of the
        Archive's interface since the project's debut in 1996. While all of the
        Archive's core features remain intact -- including the color-corrected
        images, high-resolution enlargements, scrupulous diplomatic transcriptions,
        extensive image and text search functions, and the advanced Inote and
        ImageSizer applets -- we have streamlined the site's organization and added
        major new features that we believe will significantly enhance the way the
        Archive is used for both scholarly research and teaching. These include:</p>
      
      
      <ul>
        <li>a Comparison feature which allows users viewing any one illuminated
          print to instantly compare it with other impressions in the Archive printed
          from the same copper plate;</li>
        
        
        <li>a Navigator feature which allows users to move rapidly across the
          Archive's collections, with a single click taking them from any work, copy,
          and plate, to any other work, copy, and plate;</li>
        
        
        <li>a Work Title search which allows users to access materials in the
          Archive simply by entering a title, or a known fragment of a title (e.g.,
          "The Lamb" or "Albion"); also a search function for the extensive
          illustration descriptions written by the editors;</li>
        
        
        <li>a revised transcription layout, including: easier access to textual
          notes; a new line numbering system that accounts for such items as
          catchwords and plate numbers, in keeping with the Archive's documentary
          principles; and the ability to "page" through the transcriptions in
          sequence, thereby allowing a work to be more easily read in its
          entirety;</li>
        
        
        <li>numerous functional and cosmetic adjustments to the site design and
          interface, many of them in direct response to user feedback;</li>
        
        
        <li>updated help documentation detailing all of the above features;</li>
        
        
        <li>and finally, a behind-the-scenes upgrade to a faster server and a newer
          version of the Archive's underlying DynaWeb software.</li>
      </ul>
      
      
      <p>We welcome feedback and comments on any aspect of WBA 2.0. While the
        Archive continues to remain available at its current address
        http://www.iath.virginia.edu/, we are also pleased to announce the
        registration of its domain at http://www.blakearchive.org. WBA 2.0 is
        accessible at either of these URLs.</p>
      
      
      <p>As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access
        restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible
        through the continuing support of the Institute for Advanced Technology in
        the Humanities at the University of Virginia, by a major new grant from the
        Preservation and Access Division of the National Endowment for the
        Humanities, and by the cooperation of the international array of libraries
        and museums that have generously given us permission to represent works from
        their collections in the Archive.</p>
      
      
      <p>We would also like to take this opportunity to publicly thank those
        members of the Archive's staff who were instrumental in the production of WBA
        2.0: Andrea Laue (Project Manager), Kirk Hastings (Lead Programmer/Analyst),
        David Cosca (former Lead Programmer/Analyst), and Christopher Jackson and
        Kari Kraus (Project Assistants).</p>
      
      
      <p>At present the Archive contains 41 copies of 18 of Blake's 19 illuminated
        books (all with newly edited SGML-encoded texts and images scanned and
        color-corrected from first-generation 4 x 5 inch transparencies), plus a
        fully SGML-encoded electronic edition of David. V. Erdman's <cite>Complete
          Poetry and Prose of William Blake</cite>. In the very near future we expect
        to release a much-anticipated electronic edition of <cite>Jerusalem</cite>,
        copy E; the publication of Blake's longest (and perhaps most spectacular)
        work will render the Archive's illuminated collection complete, with at least
        one copy of every work and multiple copies of most. At that point, in
        addition to continuing to publish additional copies of the works in
        illuminated printing, we will begin to incorporate Blake's accomplishments in
        other media (paintings, drawings, commercial and original engravings, and
        manuscripts). By summer we also plan to have added search functions for the
        Archive's general and specialized bibliographies of Blake scholarship
        (currently listing over 500 entries), and to publish collection handlists for
        each of the Archive's contributing institutions. Future supplementary
        materials include a biography, timeline, and in-depth study guide for
        teachers and students.</p>
