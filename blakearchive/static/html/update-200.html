      <!--<h2 class="title">William Blake Archive Update</h2>-->
      <p>21 February 2000</p>
      
      
      <p>The editors of the William Blake Archive http://www.blakearchive.org/ are
        very pleased to announce the publication of our searchable SGML-encoded
        electronic edition of David V. Erdman's <cite>Complete Poetry and Prose of
          William Blake</cite>. The addition of the electronic Erdman means that the
        site is now inclusive of an even greater range of Blake's work than the
        approximately 3000 digital images that will eventually form the structured
        core of the Archive proper. Based upon the text of the 1988 Newly Revised
        Doubleday Edition, the electronic Erdman represents almost 900 pages of
        printed material, comprising the complete writings of William Blake together
        with David V. Erdman's original textual notes (Harold Bloom's commentary
        omitted). The original ASCII text file we encoded for the electronic edition
        was generously supplied by Professor Nelson Hilton (University of Georgia),
        whose own electronic concordance to Erdman is a vital online resource for
        Blakeans.</p>
      
      
      <p>The Blake Archive's electronic Erdman is tagged in SGML using the Text
        Encoding Initiative DTD and is presented online using Inso's DynaWeb
        software. But we should note that Erdman's edition is an extraordinarily rich
        and complex textual artifact in its own right, and encoding and rendering it
        has proven a substantial technical challenge. For that reason we consider
        this a beta release, and would welcome feedback and bug reports from users
        <a href="mailto:blake@jefferson.village.virginia.edu">(blake@jefferson.village.virginia.edu)</a>.</p>
      
      
      <p>We will be updating our electronic Erdman edition continually in response
        to user feedback, correcting any mistakes and adjusting the formatting. We
        also anticipate migrating the edition to a later version of the DynaWeb
        server, which will support keyword-in-context searching (analogous to that of
        a concordance) as well as allow for greater functional integration between
        the Erdman edition and the materials in the Archive proper. We plan to emend
        the electronic edition to correct errata in the printed editions of Erdman
        that have been discovered by the Santa Cruz Blake Study Group and other
        correspondents. Finally we intend to publish a Blake Archive Supplement to
        Erdman, which will allow us to add newly discovered Blake texts to the
        printed text, thereby making the William Blake Archive's electronic edition
        truly the <i>complete</i> writings of Blake.</p>
      
      
      <p>The addition of our electronic Erdman is the first in a series of
        publications slated for this spring and summer. We will soon add two copies
        of <cite>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</cite> to the Archive, at which
        point it will contain fully searchable and scalable electronic editions of 41
        copies of 18 of Blake's 19 illuminated books in the context of full
        bibliographic information about each work, careful diplomatic transcriptions
        of all texts, detailed descriptions of all images, and extensive
        bibliographies. Soon after, we plan to publish collection lists for eight of
        the most significant collections of Blake's works. Fully encoded in SGML,
        these collection lists will be delivered online using Inso's DynaWeb software
        and will be fully searchable. Perhaps most significant will be the
        publication of <cite>Jerusalem</cite>, copy E. With this addition, the
        Archive will contain at least one copy of each of Blake's works in
        illuminated printing and multiple copies of most.</p>
