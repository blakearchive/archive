      <!--<h2 class="title">William Blake Archive Update</h2>-->
      <p>13 September 2002</p>
      
      
      <p>The William Blake Archive www.blakearchive.org is pleased to announce the
        publication of new electronic editions of three copies of <i>The [First] Book
          of Urizen</i>. Copies A, C, and F were beautifully and extensively color
        printed in the same printing session in 1794. This is the first time that
        copies C and F have been reproduced, and the first reproduction of copy A
        since 1929.</p>
      
      
      <p>Copies A and C are in the Yale Center for British Art, Yale University,
        and copy F is in the Houghton Library, Harvard University. These three copies
        join copy G, from the Rosenwald Collection, Library of Congress, and together
        comprise half the extant copies of <i>The [First] Book of Urizen</i>. Two
        other copies of <i>Urizen</i>, copy D, from the 1794 printing and copy B from
        the 1795 printing, are forthcoming.</p>
      
      
      <p>Blake etched in shallow relief the twenty-eight plates of <i>The [First]
        Book of Urizen</i> in 1794, although only copies A and B contain them all. In
        the same year, he printed proof copies H and I (only 3 and 2 plates
        respectively) and copies A, C, D, E, F, and J. Copy B was printed the
        following year as part of a set of large-paper copies of the illuminated
        books and copy G was printed in 1818. Plate 4 appears only in copies A-C (an
        impression was pulled for copy G but not included). The full-page designs are
        differently positioned in each copy; copies A, B, E, and F also have variant
        orders of text plates.</p>
      
      
      <p>The electronic editions have newly edited SGML-encoded texts and new
        images scanned and color-corrected from first-generation 4x5" transparencies;
        text and images are fully searchable and supported by the Inote and
        ImageSizer applications described in our previous updates. With the Archive's
        recently added comparison feature, users can easily juxtapose multiple
        impressions of any plate across the different copies of an illuminated book.
        New protocols for transcription, which produce improved accuracy and fuller
        documentation in editors' notes, have been applied to all the <i>Urizen</i>
        texts, including previously published copy G.</p>
      
      
      <p>With the publication of these three copies, the Archive now contains fully
        searchable and scalable electronic editions of 48 copies of 18 of Blake's 19
        illuminated books in the context of full bibliographic information about each
        work, careful diplomatic transcriptions of all texts, detailed descriptions
        of all images, and extensive bibliographies. They also join the Thomas Butts
        set of Blake's watercolors illustrating the Book of Job, and Blake's twelve
        water-color illustrations to John Milton's poems "L'Allegro" and "Il
        Penseroso," the first of several series of Milton illustrations that we will
        be adding in Preview mode. In the near future we expect to release more
        drawings and prints in Preview mode, which provides all the features of the
        Archive except Image Search and Inote, a much-anticipated electronic edition
        of <i>Jerusalem</i> copy E, and further supplementary materials, including a
        biography and glossary.</p>
      
      
      <p>The editors of the Archive recently photographed 125 works by Blake in the
        Department of Prints and Drawings, National Gallery of Art, Washington D. C.,
        including biblical watercolors, pencil drawings, and proofs in various states
        of the Job engravings. We have obtained reproductions of the Blake
        collections of the Fogg Museum of Art, Victoria and Albert Museum, the
        Metropolitan Museum, National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne, and the
        Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery. Over the next few years, we will be adding
        to the Archive these extensive collections of books, prints, and drawings,
        many of which will be reproduced in color for the first time.</p>

        restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible

        Humanities, by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and by the
