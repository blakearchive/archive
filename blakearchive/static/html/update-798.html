      <!--<h2 class="title">William Blake Archive Update</h2>-->
      <p>17 July 1998</p>
      
      
      <p>The editors of the William Blake Archive are pleased to announce the
        publication of six new electronic editions of Blake's illuminated books. They
        are:</p>
      
      
      <br/><br/>
      
      
      <ul>
        <li><cite>All Religions are One</cite> copy A</li>
        
        
        <li><cite>There is No Natural Religion</cite> copies B, C, G, and L</li>
        
        
        <li><cite>Milton, a Poem</cite> copy C</li>
      </ul>
      
      
      <p>Composed and executed in 1788, <cite>All Religions are One</cite> and
        <cite>There is No Natural Religion</cite> are Blake's first works in
        illuminated printing, though no copy of either work survives from this date.
        The ten plates of <cite>All Religions</cite> were followed quickly by twenty
        <cite>No Natural Religion</cite> plates in two antithetical sets (a and b
        series). Only one copy of <cite>All Religions</cite> is extant, now in the
        Huntington Library, printed c. 1795 with and in the same style as <cite>There
          is No Natural Religion</cite> copy L, the only copy consisting exclusively of
        the ten b-series of plates, now in The Pierpont Morgan Library. The other
        twelve recorded copies of this book consist of a mixture of the same eight to
        twelve plates, which appeared to be merely incomplete sets of proofs until it
        was discovered that six of these copies were 19th-century reproductions. Once
        the inauthentic impressions were weeded out, it became apparent that what
        remained was Blake's selection of a and b plates for an abridged version of
        the work printed around 1794. We present copies B, C, and G of this
        twelve-plate work, now in the collections of the Yale Center for British Art,
        Library of Congress, and The Pierpont Morgan Library, respectively.</p>
      
      
      <p>There are only four copies of <cite>Milton</cite>, Blake's most personal
        epic. Copy C, from the New York Public Library, was Blake's own copy. Printed
        c. 1811, it was later reconfigured and renumbered by Blake when he inserted
        extra plates, which he appears to have done on at least two different
        occasions.</p>
      
      
      <p>All of these editions have newly edited texts and are all fully searchable
        for both text and images and supported by the unique Inote and ImageSizer
        applications described in our previous updates.</p>
      
      
      <p>We now have twenty-two copies of thirteen illuminated books. Over this and
        next year, we will be adding Blake's last illuminated works, <cite>On Homers
          Poetry [&amp;] On Virgil</cite>, <cite>The Ghost of Abel</cite>, and
        <cite>Laocoon</cite>, as well as <cite>Milton</cite> copy D and
        <cite>Jerusalem</cite> copy E. We will also be adding at least six more
        copies of <cite>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</cite>, two copies of
        <cite>Songs of Innocence</cite>, five copies of <cite>The Marriage of Heaven
          and Hell</cite>, four copies of <cite>The Book of Urizen</cite>, and two
        copies each of <cite>America, a Prophecy</cite> and <cite>Europe, a
          Prophecy</cite>. In addition, work continues on the SGML edition of David V.
        Erdman's <cite>Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake</cite>.</p>
      
      
      <p>We will continue to post updates on various lists every few months, but
        readers interested in the progress of the Archive can subscribe to our Blake
        Update list, which can be found on the Archive's Contents Page. On this page
        readers will also find that we have opened the top level of the Contributing
        Institutions Page, which provides contact information and links to
        institutions participating in the Archive. In the coming months, we plan to
        include color-coded and linked lists of each institution's entire Blake
        collection to indicate what is and is not in the Archive and what is
        forthcoming.</p>
