<p><strong id="significance">1. Significance</strong></p>

      <p>Over the course of two centuries, respect for the poems, prints, and paintings of William Blake (1757-1827) 
      has increased to a degree that would have astonished his contemporaries. Now, 
      more than a century since the "Blake revival" was inaugurated by a cadre of Victorian writers 
      and artists, he is universally regarded as a seminal literary and visual artist. Today both his 
      poetry and visual art in several media are admired by a global audience. He is one of the most 
      anthologized and studied writers in English, and "The Tyger" is the most anthologized poem in 
      the language. Blake's poetry and prose have been translated into many languages, and the 
      published scholarship is international. According to G. E. Bentley, Jr., there is Blake criticism in 
      Bulgarian, Catalan, Chinese (Mandarin and Cantonese), Czech, Danish, Dutch, Esperanto, 
      Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Latin, Latvian, 
      Lithuanian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbo-Croatian, Spanish, 
      Swedish, and Welsh. <i>Blake Studies in Japan</i> (Bentley and Aoyama, 1994) alone contains nearly 
      1000 entries.</p>

      <p>Likewise, Blake is one of the most exhibited and collected of British visual artists: in April 1999, 
      one copy of his illuminated <i>[First] Book of Urizen</i> (24 plates) sold at auction for &#36;2.5 million, 
      widely noted at the time to have been the most ever paid for a work of British "literature," and in 
      2004 a color printed drawing, "The Good and Evil Angels," sold at auction for &#36;3.9 million&#8212;
      perhaps a record price for any print by anyone. In 2006 some of his newly discovered 
      watercolors for Robert Blair's <i>The Grave</i> fetched high prices at auction. In recent years large 
      shows have been mounted in Australia, England, France, Germany, Israel, Japan, Scotland, 
      Spain, and the United States, including major exhibitions in Melbourne (1989), Tokyo (1990), 
      Barcelona (1996), Madrid (1996), Melbourne (1999), Paris (2009), and New York (2009-10).</p>
          
      <p>Tate Britain's enormous 2000-01 exhibition moved to the Metropolitan Museum of New York in 
      2001, and the Huntington Library and Art Gallery mounted an exhibition in 2003. More major 
      international conferences, exhibitions, and other special events marked the 250th anniversary of 
      Blake's birth in 2007.</p>

      <p>Blake&#8212;in various configurations of his life, words, and images&#8212;has established and maintained 
      a kind of multifaceted cultural currency that is exceedingly rare. His images are icons, endlessly 
      reproduced wherever striking images are needed, and every year his words are incorporated into 
      books on science, technology, history, religion, and art. Jacob Epstein sculpted a bust of Blake; 
      Francis Bacon painted his portrait. Blake's color print <i>Newton</i>, translated into a twelve-foot 
      statue by Eduardo Paolozzi, greets all visitors to the British Library. Notable composers, 
      including Benjamin Britten, Ralph Vaughan Williams, Paul Hindemith, Gustav Holst, Virgil 
      Thomson, and William Bolcom, have set his words to music hundreds if not thousands of 
      times&#8212;more often than any British writer other than Shakespeare. There are significant Blake 
      ballets (Ralph Vaughan Williams), Blake operas (Britten's <i>The Little Sweep</i>), and Blake movies 
      (Jim Jarmusch's <i>Dead Man</i>). Since it was set to music in 1902 by Hubert Parry, the prefatory 
      poem to Blake's illuminated book <i>Milton</i>&#8212;"And did those feet in ancient time"&#8212;has evolved 
      into an alternative national anthem for the British. On the popular music scene Blake's influence 
      has been profound for more than half a century; his words have been extensively recorded by 
      major artists.</p>

      <p>Blake's resonance now extends to the students of the wide range of biblical and literary texts that 
      he illustrated. Recent interdisciplinary approaches in literary studies, art history, and religious 
      studies, especially, have encouraged students to understand illustrations as visual commentaries. 
      Blake's illustrations&#8212;those of the Book of Job and many other scenes from the Old and New 
      Testaments; Dante's <i>Divine Comedy</i>; Virgil's <i>Eclogues</i>; Chaucer's <i>Canterbury Tales</i>; Spenser's 
      <i>Fairie Queene</i>; Shakespeare's plays; Milton's <i>Paradise Lost</i>, "Nativity Ode," <i>Comus</i>, <i>Paradise 
      Regained</i>, "L'Allegro," and "Il Penseroso"; Thomas Gray's poems; and the powerful illustrations 
      to John Stedman's <i>Narrative, of a Five Years' Expedition, against the Revolted Negroes of 
      Surinam</i>, for example&#8212;offer such critical opportunities.</p>

      <p>In the broadest terms, the William Blake Archive, a closely integrated archive of scholarly digital 
      editions freely available on the World Wide Web, is a contemporary response to the needs of this 
      dispersed and various audience and to the reciprocal needs of the collections that currently hold 
      Blake's original works. Both the audience and the collections on which the audience must rely 
      share a strong interest in the accessibility and preservation of Blake's works. The Blake Archive 
      attempts to serve both sets of needs at once by providing free access to its Web site, where 
      Blake's works are accessible to a degree heretofore impossible. Whether our users' inquiries are 
      inspired by a love of imaginative art and writing, term papers, or scholarly research, no other 
      resource can match the depth or range of access provided by the archiving, searching, reading, 
      and viewing options at our Web site.</p>

      <p>But we have designed the site primarily with scholars in mind. For them we believe that the 
      Archive has become indispensable&#8212;as a handy reference, a point of departure, or a site of 
      sustained research. The Archive has adhered to exceptionally high standards of site construction, 
      digital reproduction, and digital editing that are, we believe, models of their kind. They make it 
      possible for the Archive to deliver <i>reproductions</i> that are more accurate in color, detail, and scale 
      than the finest commercially published photomechanical reproductions and texts that are more 
      faithful to Blake's own than any collected edition has provided. We have applied equally high 
      standards in supplying a wealth of contextual information, which includes full and accurate 
      bibliographical details and meticulous descriptions of the content of each image. Finally, users of 
      the Archive can attain a new degree of access to these works through the combination of 
      powerful text-searching and (for the first time in any medium) advanced image-searching tools 
      that are made possible by the editors' XML markup systems, detailed image descriptions, and 
      innovative text and image software. Although we have designed the Archive to function properly 
      within the limits of existing systems, we have built in considerable allowance for future 
      improvements in hardware and software.</p>

      <p>The Blake Archive first opened to the public in 1996 with simple reproductions from two of 
      Blake's early "illuminated books" in "illuminated printing," as he labeled them. The 
      reproductions were lightly encoded (in HTML only) and accompanied by little contextual 
      information, with no search capabilities. The Archive now contains fully searchable digital 
      editions of many copies of Blake's illuminated books in the context of full, up-to-date 
      bibliographic information about each image, carefully edited transcriptions of all texts, detailed 
      descriptions of all images, and extensive bibliographies of Blake's works and scholarship about 
      Blake. This expansion has also seen the inclusion of examples of Blake's other work&#8212;
      commercial book illustrations, separate prints, drawings and paintings, manuscripts, and printed 
      books&#8212;as well as a searchable digital version of David V. Erdman's <i>The Complete Poetry and 
      Prose of William Blake</i>, a standard printed edition for reference.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, the roster of major contributors has grown to encompass every major Blake 
      collection in the world: the Library of Congress (now a sponsor) has been joined by the 
      Huntington Library and Art Gallery; the Essick Collection; the New York Public Library; the 
      Morgan Library and Museum, New York; the Houghton Library and Fogg Museum of Art at 
      Harvard; the Yale Center for British Art; the Glasgow University Library; the Fitzwilliam 
      Museum, Cambridge; the British Museum; the National Gallery of Art, Washington; the 
      National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne; the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; the 
      Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; the Birmingham Museums and Art Gallery; the Whitworth Art 
      Gallery, Manchester; the Victoria and Albert Museum; the British Library; the Tate Collection; 
      the Louvre Museum; the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford; the Bodleian Library, Oxford; the J. Paul 
      Getty Museum; the Royal Institution of Cornwall; and the Victoria Library at the University of 
      Toronto, among others (see <a href="staticpage/archiveataglance?p=contributingcollections" target="_blank">Contributing Collections for a complete list</a>). Our success to date in 
      obtaining the confidence and goodwill of owners has reassured us that a rather vast undertaking 
      such as ours is possible at the present time. As it is difficult to know how long present 
      opportunities will last, we are pressing forward now.</p>

      <p>Further acknowledgement of the significance of the Blake Archive as a progressive scholarly and 
      pedagogical enterprise has come from the Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities 
      at the University of Virginia, which first perceived the value of undertaking such a challenging 
      project; the Getty Grant Program, which provided major funding for the first phase of design and 
      construction; and the Preservation and Access and Scholarly Editions and Translations divisions 
      of the National Endowment for the Humanities, which helped to fund our second and fourth 
      phases of development. We have benefited from additional grants from the Paul Mellon Centre 
      for Studies in British Art, London, in addition to software and hardware contributions from Sun 
      Microsystems and Inso Corporation, and support from the Carolina Digital Library and Archives (CDLA) 
      at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the Department of English at the University of Rochester.</p>

      <p><strong>Scholarship</strong>: The Archive had its origins in the fortunate confluence of four phenomena during 
      one brief span of time in the early 1990s: the completion of a broad base of mature Blake 
      scholarship, capped by the publication of the first trustworthy map of the history of Blake's 
      illuminated book production; the appearance of technology sufficiently revolutionary to alter 
      some fundamental assumptions in scholarly editing; the emergence of new technical standards 
      sufficiently robust to check, if not eliminate, the formidable threat of overnight obsolescence for 
      large undertakings such as ours; and, finally, the creation of organizations specifically devoted to 
      giving digital form to the ideas of humanists. Together these four developments combined to 
      provide the cornerstone of integrated archival, editorial, and educational initiatives that would 
      have been impossible ten years, and probably too risky even five years, earlier.</p>
      <p>Despite decades of scholarship, the knowledge of Blake's work was fragmentary and 
      unsystematic until the final quarter of the twentieth century, partly because the upturn in his 
      reputation came so long after his death but largely because the study of Blake has often split into 
      distinct institutional compartments. Literary critics and art historians operate with different 
      assumptions, values, aims, and procedures even when investigating the same original materials, 
      as they were in this case. The resulting lack of coordination delayed the appearance of the 
      standard tools of reference and reproduction that represent what we know about Blake, a 
      printmaker and painter who was also an author.</p>

      <p>But by the late 1980s the standard points of reference had at last fallen into place: reliable printed 
      editions of the poetry, prose, and letters (Bentley 1978, Erdman 1982); excellent, if rare and 
      expensive, facsimiles of one (but only one) of each of Blake's illuminated books (Blake Trust-
      Trianon Press facsimiles, 1951-1976); documentary records of the life (Bentley 1969, 1988); and 
      sound catalogues of the major categories of Blake's oeuvre, including the drawings and paintings 
      (Butlin 1981), illuminated books and secondary criticism (Bentley 1977, 1995), complete 
      graphic works (Bindman 1978), separate plates (Essick 1983), and commercial engravings 
      (Essick 1991), augmented by numerous subsidiary catalogues that fill out the picture of Blake's 
      multifaceted productive life. However, the crucial piece of this foundation that concerned Blake's 
      illuminated books was weakened by errors that had generated a history of false inference and an 
      essentially false overall picture. In 1993, building on the work of Robert N. Essick and G. E. 
      Bentley, Jr. but reassessing the fundamental evidence, Joseph Viscomi's <i>Blake and the Idea of 
      the Book</i> redrew the map of Blake's productions in his most famous and difficult medium, 
      illuminated printing. This indispensable if uncoordinated legacy of scholarship in disparate 
      disciplines set the stage for a new phase of radical editorial revision of a kind that would be 
      almost unimaginable in the medium of print.</p>

      <p><strong>Technology</strong>: The technology that held the most promise in such a case was of course global 
      network computing via the internet and World Wide Web, which made it possible to conceive a 
      long-distance professional collaboration and an "edition" of Blake that would transcend the 
      limitations of conventional scholarly editing and, in the process, render irrelevant the gap 
      between the original works in restricted collections, the incomplete sets of expensive facsimiles 
      in the rare book rooms of some large university libraries, and the indispensable but highly 
      misleading printed editions on which "readers" had relied for their "Blake" since the Victorian 
      Blake revival.</p>

      <p><strong>Encoding system</strong>: But we were wary. Like everyone else in the humanities, we had seen grand 
      scholarly hopes crucified on the cross of technological change and instant obsolescence. Not 
      long before we began thinking seriously about the uses of digital technology, an unanticipated 
      change in proprietary videodisc technology had pulled the rug out from under an ambitious 
      scheme to reproduce a substantial selection of Blake's images at the University of Iowa. The PC-
      Mac wars of the era were another reminder of the danger. But the promise of platform 
      independence and portability represented by the codification of Standard Generalized Markup 
      Language (SGML, the source of the Web's HTML and later XML) and its scholarly counterpart 
      in the coordinated standards of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI, 1987-) finally made it 
      plausible to devote years of work to a digital scholarly resource in the humanities.</p>

      <p><strong>Institutional base</strong>: But the promise of closing the editorial gap forced us, as humanists, to face 
      the technological gap: we could half-envision digital remedies that we could not execute. At that 
      point, in 1993, we crossed paths with the new <a href="http://www.iath.virginia.edu" target="_blank">Institute for Advanced Technology in the 
      Humanities</a> at the University of Virginia (1992-). IATH's mission, we heard, was to help 
      humanists use new information technology in carrying out their projects by supplying the 
      requisite expertise and equipment at the research and development stage.</p>

      <p>Our preliminary discussions with the staff of IATH introduced us to an exotic new world of 
      markup codes, servers and clients, the Web, and Java. But the primary consequence was the 
      conception of a William Blake Archive, which would be a comprehensive but coherent array of 
      digital scholarly editions to be made available free of charge on the Web. We came to believe 
      that, given an elegant design and sufficiently powerful features&#8212;including an innovative way of 
      searching for individual details in all the images in addition to the more conventional searches 
      for specific texts&#8212;our project would help to set the pattern for serious art-historical and textual 
      scholarship by digital means at a key moment in their evolution. For a large international 
      community of art historians and literary critics, among others, the Blake Archive would be a 
      powerful reference tool, offering high-quality reproductions of an important body of work&#8212;
      much of it previously unreproduced, badly reproduced, or reproduced in rare volumes&#8212;and 
      making that work accessible and usable in new ways that would improve interdisciplinary 
      knowledge in areas where more and better knowledge was sorely needed.</p>

      <p>Literary critics tend to favor the illuminated books in their research; art historians tend to favor 
      paintings, prints, and drawings. While those disciplinary biases are of course natural and to some 
      extent inevitable, the price of such specialized attention&#8212;in understanding the full artistic 
      situation&#8212;has often been higher than it should be or needs to be. By incorporating as much of 
      Blake's pictorial and literary canon as possible&#8212;with both images and texts organized, 
      interlinked, and searchable in ways that only hypermedia systems will allow&#8212;the Archive would 
      for the first time give scholars and students access to the major intersections between the 
      illuminated books and Blake's other creative and commercial works. That is to say, by exploiting 
      new information technology to deliver the historical, technical, and aesthetic contexts necessary 
      to study Blake as printmaker, painter, and poet, the Archive would encourage a deeper, more 
      responsible understanding of his aims and methods, which have been regularly misunderstood 
      and misrepresented.</p>

      <p>The concrete results
would be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a large,
searchable hypermedia
archive on the World Wide Web; and</li>

  <li>eventually, once the architecture of the Web-based
archive was
substantially complete and a
broad representation of Blake's work was in place, a series of the
works on portable media such as CD-ROM or DVD-ROM disks.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both products would be designed for use by a broad audience of scholars and students in their 
studies, classrooms, and museums. At this time, portability made disks a popular medium in 
classrooms and on desktop computers. But for scholars doing sustained original research, there 
would be no adequate substitute for global access to a platform-independent William Blake 
Archive published on the Web.</p>

<p>Thus all along our fundamental aim has been to construct a unified international resource out of 
highly disparate and dispersed original materials to which access is ordinarily limited by 
institutional and other restrictions and by the sheer cost and difficulty of travel. As a public 
resource, the Blake Archive would be maintained free and open to all those who have access to 
the Web anywhere. We hoped we could persuade major collectors and collections of Blake 
material to agree to contribute their works to the Archive in precisely that public spirit, especially 
considering that very few works by Blake are on permanent exhibition due to concern about the 
effects of handling and excessive exposure to light. Several major institutional collections had 
severely limited even scholars' access to the fragile originals. This included at least two of our 
contributors, the Huntington and the Fitzwilliam. Both institutions had disbound and/or rebound 
several illuminated books in an attempt to improve preservation. Our contribution to these 
attempts at preservation is very direct: by making available searchable and sizeable images of the 
highest quality, we can provide access without compromising preservation in any way. 
Institutions that contribute to the Archive can continue to provide scholars and the public full 
access to these treasures while at the same time taking all necessary measures to preserve the 
originals. As a curator wrote to us, "I look forward to viewing [his institution's illuminated 
books]. You will probably know that we have now made a link from our web pages to the Blake 
Archive so that users can easily view our copies rather than over-tax the originals. With a fast-
enough machine they come up almost instantaneously."</p>

            <p>Once archived digitally, structured and tagged (indexed for retrieval in SGML&#8212;and now in XML&#8212;adapted to our purposes), annotated with detailed descriptions, and orchestrated with a powerful search engine (in this case DynaWeb software), the images in the Archive could be examined like ordinary color reproductions. But they could also be searched alongside the texts, enlarged, computer enhanced, juxtaposed in numerous combinations, and otherwise manipulated to investigate features (such as the etched basis of the designs and texts) that had heretofore been imperceptible without close first-hand scrutiny of the far-flung original works. For example, the information necessary for doing good art history would enable scholars and students to draw sound conclusions about the differences between what Blake etched on his copper plates and what was added or changed afterwards in printing and coloring the impressions. But the published reproductions upon which much art-historical study necessarily depends simply cannot record such details with sufficient accuracy. Even scholars who are able to globetrot from collection to collection end up relying heavily upon their inadequate memories, notes, photocopies, and photographs to compensate for the distances in time and space between collections. Seeing the originals is good in itself; but seeing them in fine, trustworthy reproductions, in context and in relation to one another, is the scholarly ideal. Difficulty of access to originals and reliance on inadequate reproductions have handicapped and distorted even the best efforts. Again, the inevitable result has all too frequently been distortions of the record, misconstructions, and the waste of considerable scholarly labor.</p>

            <p>We began by tackling the multitude of challenges presented by a single category of Blake's work, his illuminated books. The illuminated books had their genesis in a series of graphic experiments that Blake began around 1788 and quickly evolved into a program of combining visual and textual elements in printed pages that he could control&#8212;design, write, etch, print, and color&#8212;himself. Though he produced a great deal of important work in other media, the illuminated books (c. 1788-1827) span most of his productive life and reflect its characteristic patterns. These much discussed books are fundamental to his artistic reputation for several good reasons: they are spectacular examples of the illustrated book at one extreme of its development; fascinating explorations of the interactions between texts and designs at a level of narrative maturity seldom matched and never exceeded; major instances of the transformations of traditional iconography in the late eighteenth century; and central documents in British romanticism, both as historical period and as ideology.</p>

            <p>In his lifetime, Blake produced about 175 copies of his 19 illuminated books. About 20% of those&#8212;40 or so&#8212;have been reproduced in print, sometimes well, sometimes execrably, but in no coherent historical order. By the end of the first phase of our project, in June 2000, we had reproduced 41 copies, about half of which had never been reproduced before. This constituted, for the first time, an archive of reproductions suitable for serious research. Only since the mid-1990s, largely as a result of Viscomi's extensive research, has the history of the production of the illuminated books been correctly understood. That in turn made possible for the first time a rigorously constructed scholarly archive, including numerous copies of the illuminated books that had been neglected because their place in the history of production was not understood.</p>

<p>Our next task was to add drawings; paintings; and several kinds of prints, manuscripts, and rare 
or unique typographical works to the Archive. Doing so yields an augmented "Blake" 
considerably larger than the one most familiar to students and scholars, especially those who 
approach Blake from the literary side. Without sacrificing the Blake of the <i>Songs of Innocence 
and of Experience</i> and <i>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</i>, the extended Archive reveals the 
painter-printmaker whose illuminated books emerged from the materials, work routines, and 
imagery of eighteenth-century history painting, water color drawing, and graphic arts, as well as 
from the literary routines of Milton, the Bible, Swedenborg, and Boehme, which students of 
Blake have more often investigated. Commercial illustrations, for example, can bring into focus 
a major convergence between Blake's illuminated book <i>Visions of the Daughters of Albion</i> 
(1793) and his engravings to J. G. Stedman's <i>Narrative, of a Five Years' Expedition, against the 
Revolted Negroes of Surinam</i> (etched 1791). Even the familiar profile of a poet-Blake can be 
deepened by the inclusion of Blake's extensive group of literary illustrations, such as those to the 
Bible and to the poems of Dante, Milton, Gray, Blair, and Young, among others.</p>

<p>We have come to see the Blake project as a pacesetting instance of a fundamental shift in the 
ideas of "archive," "catalogue," and "edition" as both processes and products. Though "edition" 
and "archive" are the terms we have fallen back on, in fact we have envisioned a resource unlike 
any other currently available&#8212;a hybrid all-in-one edition, catalogue, database, and set of 
scholarly tools capable of taking full advantage of the opportunities offered by new information 
technology.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Uses of the Blake Archive as a prototype</strong>: The Blake Archive is not designed to be an isolated 
                resource. It is now one of very many digital resources for scholarly research. Thus we have been 
                members of the groundbreaking <a href="http://www.nines.org" target="_blank">NINES</a> (Networked Infrastructure for Nineteenth-Century 
                Digital Scholarship) consortium from its inception in 2003. But until the standards for such 
                resources evolve, projects like ours must be in the business of setting standards by designing 
                prototype tools and techniques. A guiding aim of our project is to solve problems with methods 
                that are widely applicable. The collaborative procedures we are developing, which we hope will 
                become useful prototypes of "distance editing," depend upon intensive and extensive day-to-day 
                teamwork among the three editors and their editorial staffs and programmers at the University of 
                North Carolina and University of Rochester to integrate the textual, art-historical, critical, and 
                technical expertise necessary for the construction of a scholarly resource as complex as this one.</p>
          
          <p>We see the products of our collaboration as similarly prototypical: in facing new technical and editorial challenges, the Blake Archive will make available new tools for future archivers, editors, and cataloguers. The perception that our editorial and technical experience is directly relevant to other projects has generated steadily increasing interest in the Archive that has nothing to do with Blake per se. Hence, for example, we have been invited to speak at numerous meetings where the subject was not Blake but the digital humanities or editorial theory.</p>
          
          <p>Because the signal advantage of digital editing and cataloguing is the open-endedness that makes it possible to add materials, correct errors, incorporate new discoveries, and construct new relationships, we have believed from the first that our principal objective&#8212;the most significant contribution we can hope to make&#8212;should be the creation of a sound and durable foundation for decades of future scholarship. Since 1995, when the Getty Grant Program underwrote the initial phase of our project, we have worked to shape the foundations of the Archive in strict accordance with our original ideals and priorities.</p>

                      <p><strong>Background, 1991-1994</strong>: In 1991-93, at work on two printed volumes in a new series published 
                            by the Blake Trust, Tate Gallery, and Princeton University Press (see <a href="staticpage/archiveataglance?p=editorialprinciples" target="_blank">Editorial Principles</a>), we 
                            came face to face with the limitations of even lavishly illustrated books for the kind of Blake 
                            edition we had envisioned and began to conceive the outlines of an digital edition that might 
                            overcome many of these limitations.</p>
                      
                      <p>With this in mind, at the urging of Jerome McGann we visited IATH in the summer of 1993 to 
                            see his <a href="http://www.rossettiarchive.org" target="_blank">Rossetti project</a> (see "The Rossetti Archive and Image-Based Digital Editing," 1996; 
                            "<a href="http://www2.iath.virginia.edu/jjm2f/rationale.htm" target="_blank">The Rationale of Hypertext</a>," 1997; and "<a href="http://www2.iath.virginia.edu/jjm2f/old/chum.html" target="_blank">Imagining What You Don't Know: The Theoretical 
                                  Goals of the Rossetti Archive</a>," 1998) and to meet with the staff of the Institute, including John 
                            Unsworth, who was the new director. After extensive discussions and demonstrations, we 
                            concluded not only that our concept of a rather primitive digital edition was technically feasible 
                            but also that a scholarly resource far more ambitiously transformative was within the realm of 
                            possibility.</p>
                      
                      <p>In 1994 we applied to become Associate Networked Fellows of IATH and drew up a preliminary proposal for a Blake "archive"&#8212;appropriating McGann's term for our somewhat different purposes&#8212;in three major phases that would tackle, first, the difficulties presented by the illuminated books; second, the remaining categories of work in Blake's oeuvre (prints, paintings, drawings, manuscripts, typographical works); and, third, such issues as secondary publication (on disks), interpretive supplementary material, and educational applications. A great deal of further planning over the course of the year developed this initial proposal into the original blueprint for the Archive.</p>
                      
                      <p><strong>Blake Archive, phase one, 1994-2000</strong>: In 1995 we received a grant from the Getty Grant Program to underwrite the initial three years of planning and execution focused on the illuminated books. The Blake project was the first opportunity for IATH to work intensively with researchers from outside the University of Virginia community. The Institute provided the team with full-scale technical assistance and design consultation, along with the necessary equipment to establish the foundations of the Archive.</p>
                      
                      <p><strong>Year 1, 1995-96</strong>: The Institute phase of the project began with Joseph Viscomi as a resident fellow for the year. With our first project manager, Amy Sexton, and a student technical assistant in place, the three editors met with IATH staff in the summer of 1995&#8212;in retrospect, the first "Blake camp," as we came to call these annual planning and problem-solving sessions. We drew up a two-phase plan with illuminated books in the first phase and all other works in the second. At the end of the second phase the architecture of the Blake Archive would be complete and all its wings would have substantial content.</p>
                      
                      <p>We settled easily into our division of labor as an outgrowth of the editors' experience with the 
                            Blake Trust volumes. We would make all final decisions collectively. We would deal with 
                            institutions according to our individual experience with them. Beyond that, Eaves and Essick 
                            would share major responsibility for generating the bibliographical information and image 
                            descriptions. Viscomi would take major responsibility for generating digital images and 
                            transcriptions of Blake's texts. Among other duties&#8212;parsing the SGML markup, moving works 
                            from testing to publication, etc.&#8212;the project manager would coordinate activities at IATH, 
                            including our project's access to the technical staff. Everyone would proofread and test.</p>
                      
                      <p>We compiled a prioritized list of illuminated books (for our principles of selection, see <a href="staticpage/archiveataglance?p=editorialprinciples" target="_blank">Editorial 
                            Principles</a>) and began to seek cooperation from key collections of Blake material. After reading 
                            and consultation that included sessions with a member of the Getty/MESL (Museum Educational 
                            Site Licensing) project in digital imaging, we conducted extensive trials to determine the 
                            optimum balance of photographic format, scanning resolution, and file size for an archive of this 
                            type. Key benchmarks were arrived at (see <a href="staticpage/archiveataglance?p=editorialprinciples" target="_blank">Editorial Principles</a>), and enough fundamental design 
                            work was completed to move us to the next stage. We established blake-proj, the online 
                            discussion group that has proven essential to the collaboration that has been a hallmark of the 
                            Archive's development (see Morris Eaves, "<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=jep;view=text;rgn=main;idno=3336451.0003.202" target="_blank">Behind the Scenes at the William Blake Archive: 
                                  Collaboration Takes More Than E-Mail</a>," <i>The Journal of Digital Publishing</i> 3.2 (Dec. 1997).</p>
                      
                      <p>By the end of the inaugural year we had concluded agreements with four contributors that control access to thousands of Blake's images: the Library of Congress (which became our official co-sponsor), the Huntington Library and Art Galleries (now the Huntington Library, Art Collections, and Botanical Gardens), Glasgow University Library in Scotland, and the Essick Collection, the largest collection of Blake and his followers in private hands. The editors personally supervised a six-day photographic session at the Library of Congress that yielded 620 images. All the new photography was in our benchmark format, 4" x 5" color transparencies with color bars and gray scales.</p>
                      
                      <p>During the year we made our first public outings. We presented our plans at the Society for Textual Studies meeting in New York and did our first demonstration (using mockups) at the meeting of the Society for Documentary Editing in Baltimore. Finally, we opened a Web version of the Blake Archive to the public with two copies each of Blake's <i>Book of Thel</i> and <i>Visions of the Daughters of Albion</i>, using the first version of our page design, lightly coded in HTML only, with no search capabilities or Java applets.</p>
                      
                      <p>Year 2, 1996-97: In retrospect this was a make-or-break year. At the second summer Blake 
                            camp we discussed our goals: to pursue negotiations with additional major collections; to 
                            complete the first version of the Blake Archive DTD&#8212;the Document Type Definition (DTD) for 
                            the SGML-encoded illuminated books; to add search capabilities for images as well as for texts; 
                            and to ready for testing a single work for publication in something approaching a fully operative 
                            form. New hardware (a server), software (DynaWeb, a search engine), and technical support 
                            were donated by Sun Microsystems and Inso Corporation.</p>
                      
                      <p>A major initial challenge was to find a system to base our image searches on. We began by giving careful consideration to two leading candidates. "Computer vision" or "pattern recognition" searches attempt to identify objects in digitized images by recognizing patterns (wheat vs. waves). Controlled-vocabulary searches operate by assigning words to pictures (sheep, Urizen, finger, contrapposto). The most formidable iconographic classification system is Iconclass, developed by a Leiden art historian, Henri van der Waal, and published after his death in 17 volumes, 1973-85.</p>
                      
                      <p>Computer vision is a fascinating research subject in computer labs but, we quickly discovered, completely incapable of making the precise discriminations we had in mind. <a href="http://www.iconclass.nl/home" target="_blank">Iconclass</a> is more capable&#8212;with the advantage of being a published point of reference. But though it aspires to be a universal system of image description, Iconclass was first used to describe medieval and Renaissance iconography, and it is still best suited to images that are typical of a certain school of art. Its classifications are very different from our intricate descriptions of individual images and their numerous components.</p>
                      
                      <p>Blake's works are full of unconventional elements. His uniqueness and the specificity of Blake studies require a more detailed and precise semantics, we concluded, than a general system like Iconclass provides. Thus we set out to develop our own controlled vocabulary of descriptive terms empirically, in the course of describing the images for the first time&#8212;a procedure we have followed throughout the project with excellent results, we believe. We remain open to alternatives, however.</p>
                      
                      <p>We decided to incorporate two significant reference works: an extensive bibliography of works useful in the study of Blake and David V. Erdman's standard printed edition, <i>The Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake</i> (complete with Erdman's textual notes). We published the first bibliography in 1997. The Erdman edition presented more formidable challenges, including a separate TEI-compliant DTD. The first round of encoding was completed in 1997, but, in order to create a searchable text, integrated with the rest of the Archive, a good deal of further work was required. (We tested two early versions and published early in 2000.)</p>
                      
                      <p>A sophisticated final design for the site, complete with search engine and a Java applet, Inote, was refined over several months of discussion, experiment, testing, and revision. Inote, a tool designed at IATH for image viewing and annotation, was integrated with the search engine to zoom in automatically on particular visual details and display the editors' descriptions in image searches. We decided that users must also have a way of controlling the size of images. The result was ImageSizer, a second Java applet, which allows a user to view images at their original size or to enlarge and reduce them at will.</p>
                      
                      <p>Meanwhile, the three editors at their separate outposts and the project manager and technical assistant at IATH proceeded according to the division of labor that had been worked out the previous year. Digital scanning, painstaking image-by-image color correction on specialized professional equipment, and elaborate SGML markup of all images began in earnest. As always, the Archive discussion group blake-proj remained the place where all momentous and trivial issues were hashed out. In addition, we created a work-in-progress Web site (our WIP site), accessible by password, where we could conduct all our pre-publication testing.</p>
                      
                      <p>During the year we made public presentations of the Archive in New York; Washington, DC; New Haven; Cambridge, UK; and Oxford, UK. We also reached final agreements with two new contributors, the New York Public Library and the Yale Center for British Art, and continued the process of acquiring and scanning 4" x 5" transparencies as we approached other major repositories.</p>
                      
                      <p><strong>Years 3-4, 1997-99</strong>: Whatever remained unresolved in our usual forums&#8212;the work-in-progress 
                            site and blake-proj&#8212;was moved onto the agenda of our third Blake camp, where we were able to 
                            get to the bottom of thorny problems&#8212;the logic of searches, the operation of Inote, the 
                            consistency of displays, the structure of the SGML hierarchy, editorial formats&#8212;that were 
                            blocking the first publication of a fully searchable and resizable work in the Archive. After two 
                            months of intensive tweaking and testing, we added a detailed help document and opened the 
                            new site to the public in August 1997 with a single work, <i>The Book of Thel</i> copy F, from the 
                            Library of Congress&#8212;a mere eight plates but, as far as we were concerned, a landmark.</p>
                      
                      <p>We determined that 1997-99 were to be years of production and publication that would move us toward the primary goal we specified in the original plan: to publish at least one copy of each of Blake's 19 illuminated books, along with multiple copies of several books. As of June 1998, 23 copies of 13 books had been published; as of June 1999, 33 copies of 18 books had been published. (For information on the significance of individual copies, see <a href="staticpage/update?p=all-updates" target="_blank">Blake Archive Updates</a>).</p>
                      
                      <p>In early 1999 we also added a new wing to the site. <a href="staticpage/archiveataglance" target="_blank">About the Archive</a> made available a large body of documentation and supplementary material: the Archive at a Glance (for a quick overview), Editorial Principles, a Technical Summary, a detailed Plan of the Archive, Frequently Asked Questions, and a list of published scholarship about the Archive along with published reviews of the project. In June 1999 we added a long-anticipated Tour of the Archive. Through a sequence of several dozen graphical screenshots linked to narrative commentary, the Tour introduced users to the basic organization and structure of the Archive, the features of its interface, its search options, and the function of the Inote and ImageSizer applications. Since then, we have continued to revise and expand About the Archive.</p>
                      
                      <p>During these years we reached agreements with the Pierpont Morgan Library (now the Morgan Library and Museum), New York; the Houghton Library, Harvard University; and the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge University. We were well along in the process of acquiring the necessary photographs from these collections, some by generous loans of file transparencies, others by new photography: at the Morgan, for instance, the editors supervised a three-day photographic session that produced 255 images. In 1997-98 the Archive received a modest grant from the Paul Mellon Centre for the Study of British Art, London, the first ever given by the Mellon Centre in support of a digital project. We gave public presentations of the project on several occasions (see <a href="staticpage/update?p=presentations" target="_blank">Presentations and Demonstrations about the Archive</a>); a well attended session on romanticism at the annual MLA meeting (San Francisco, Dec. 1998) eventuated in the publication of several papers on the Archive (<i>Wordsworth Circle</i> 30.3 [summer 1999]; see <a href="staticpage/archiveataglance?p=articlesindex" target="_blank">Articles about the Archive</a>).</p>
                      
                      <p><strong>Year
                            5, 1999-2000</strong>: We spent the
                            year consolidating our gains and
                            preparing to initiate, in 2000-03, a second phase of development.</p>
                      
                      <p>Matthew Kirschenbaum, who had served as our project manager while a graduate student at the University of Virginia, became our technical editor when he moved to his new faculty position in humanities research computing at the University of Kentucky (since 2001, at the University of Maryland). Kirschenbaum's appointment, one of the first of its kind in the nation, allowed him to continue overseeing the technical development of the project in collaboration with IATH, while also working to refine some of its potential contributions to the digital humanities and digital libraries, such as the Archive's prototypes for searching and manipulating structured image-based data and the expansion of the Archive's DTD into a more generalized resource usable by other projects.</p>
                      
                      <p>After final testing, we published our TEI-compliant, searchable digital version of David Erdman's edition of <i>The Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake</i>, which had been in production for more than three years.</p>
                      
                      <p>We continued publishing additional copies of illuminated books in order to clear our second hurdle: after publishing one copy of every illuminated book, to publish at least one copy of every printing of every book, according to the historical rationale that sets our priorities (see <a href="staticpage/archiveataglance?p=editorialprinciples" target="_blank">Editorial Principles</a>). We also added multiple copies of works from several printings&#8212;mostly copies that have seldom or never been reproduced or reproduced badly&#8212;and began to create the structure that would eventually allow us to incorporate related materials that help to document the history of production in context (individual proofs, early states, sketches, associated drawings, prints, and paintings).</p>
                      
                      <p>The last illuminated book to be represented in the Archive, Blake's 100-plate <i>Jerusalem</i> (copy E, 
                            the only complete colored copy, from the Yale Center for British Art), continued to serve, while 
                            in development for several years, as an object of editorial inquiry that led gradually to major 
                            changes in our protocols. Our newly convened advisory board&#8212;a broad group of museum 
                            curators, art historians, textual critics, romanticists, authorities in the digital humanities, and 
                            Blake scholars&#8212;agreed to participate in the testing of new works at our work-in-progress site. 
                            To facilitate communication, we set up a new online discussion group for them.</p>
                      
                      <p>Meanwhile, we reviewed our procedures for reproducing images in discussions with experts in 
                            image compression at the University of Rochester, Kodak, and Xerox, including members of the 
                            international team that developed JPEG 2000 (see <a href="staticpage/archiveataglance?p=techsummary" target="_blank">Technical Summary</a>).</p>
                      
                      <p>Finally, of course, we continued to acquire additional works from our contributing institutions and to establish cooperation with others. But we already had access to more than enough material to represent very amply the artistic range of Blake and his contemporaries. We also presented our project in a variety of public forums in cities including Dublin, Ireland; Charlottesville, Virginia; and Halifax, Nova Scotia.</p>
                      
                      <p>Phase two, 2000-03: As our initial three-year funding from the Getty Grant Program allowed us to initiate the first (five-year) phase of our work, an NEH Preservation and Access grant allowed us to initiate a new phase of development with three principal aims: to continue adding illuminated books to the Archive; to extend the image-oriented Blake Archive DTD and stylesheets to accommodate the other categories of Blake's works; and to incorporate a significant representation of work from these categories into the new wings of the Archive, including a preview wing&#8212;a provisional area that would allow a more expeditious movement of works from the editorial pipeline into the Archive proper. In the process, we aimed to greatly increase the size of the Archive and make it fully representative of the range of Blake's work.</p>
                      
                      <p>We began by assessing the requirements, scholarly and technical, of each category of work 
                            required to complete the structure of the Archive: prints (original and reproductive), paintings, 
                            drawings, manuscripts, and typographical works. From that assessment flowed the design for our 
                            original SGML architecture. Although we started with the illuminated books because they 
                            required us to address the problems of both texts and pictures (discrete, juxtaposed, and fused), 
                            the other categories of Blake's oeuvre are distinct in important respects. For instance, the 
                            illuminated books are book-like in scale; none is as small as Blake's smallest works or as large as 
                            his largest paintings. The issue of scale&#8212;to take only that one&#8212;raises art-historical questions 
                            (should we continue to privilege the actual size of the images?) and technical questions (should 
                            we limit the use of ImageSizer or extend its capabilities?) that we have had to deal with. The task 
                            at hand was to anticipate changes in the DTD and stylesheets, interface, image descriptions, and 
                            art-historical and textual information, and arrive at an initial set of blueprints that would allow us 
                            to add new subcategories of Blake's work to the Archive.</p>
                      
                      <p>Much of the work of the second phase was behind the scenes&#8212;making editorial changes, 
                            creating prototypes, and running tests. These were precursors to basic revisions of the elements 
                            in the DTD on which the Archive rested. We adopted a radical documentary-style line-
                            numbering scheme capable of accommodating not just conventional printed literary texts, such 
                            as poetry, but any text&#8212;inscriptions, labels on engravings, signatures and imprints on 
                            engravings, monograms, and numbers. We revised the stylesheets that control the display of 
                            works, and we modified the "copy headers" and "object headers" that deliver fundamental 
                            bibliographical information about the images to the user. We also implemented new transcription 
                            standards in the display of several of Blake's works. These standards attempted to adhere to the 
                            shape of Blake's text more closely than we were previously able to reproduce in a digital 
                            medium. New servers installed at IATH in 2003 improved access times, which were increasingly 
                            important as the Archive continued to expand the number of works on the site and as more users 
                            came to the site.</p>
                      
                      <p>Along with the redesign and extension of the DTD came problems of rendering and 
                            description&#8212;how to render images across various new categories in ways that would be coherent 
                            with the rest of the Archive and yet remain faithful to the images themselves. Blake's work 
                            beyond the illuminated-book canon includes the drawings, paintings, and prints to which the 
                            artist devoted most of his productive life, along with important typographical works and 
                            manuscripts. Although the Archive has been designed with the aim of accommodating all of 
                            Blake's work (and, for that matter, the work of his contemporaries as well), these additional 
                            categories have required special attention at each stage: scanning and correcting line engravings, 
                            for instance, present new technical problems, such as a tendency toward optical distortion in 
                            areas of close crosshatching, that we have had to solve; single "paintings," separate "plates," and 
                            continuous "pages" of type involve us in structural relations distinct from those characteristic of 
                            the illuminated books. Similarly, we have been working out protocols for describing images that 
                            are in many respects unlike the images of the illuminated books for which our controlled 
                            vocabulary was developed.</p>
                      
                      <p>We addressed these problems in the process of publishing two extensive bodies of work that we identified as the most logical extensions of the Archive: Blake's illustrations (in several media) to the Book of Job and to the poetry of John Milton (almost 200 items). (Users had requested Blake's designs to Job, Milton, and Dante.) These images, which are often historically, thematically, and formally related to the illuminated books, meet two criteria of "significance": they are representative of Blake's oeuvre as a whole, and they are among the works most often studied by Blake scholars. Hence they constituted a logical, large, but manageable first extension of what we had already done. The Huntington, one of our contributors, holds the world's largest collection of Blake's illustrations to the works of Milton.</p>
                      
                      <p>Our second phase involved the difficult transition from a specialized to a generalized framework: 
                            from one capable of supporting a specialized collection (of illuminated books) to one capable of 
                            supporting a far broader combination of texts and images, plus extensive information about them and 
                            robust scholarly tools to manipulate them. Obviously, it is hard to predict in advance exactly 
                            where that broadening must occur: thus the prototypes and trial runs, which have a way of 
                            turning up unexpected anomalies. We chose Blake's engraved <i>Illustrations of the Book of Job</i>, 
                            one of his masterpieces, because the basic configuration of image and text in the Job plates is 
                            different from that of the illuminated books&#8212;and thus presents different display problems&#8212;and 
                            because the images themselves are often very dense and crowded with elaborate details.</p>
                      
                      <p>Materials beyond the illuminated books present several editorial challenges&#8212;from convoluted 
                            transcriptions featuring multiple foreign-character sets to large images requiring adjustments to 
                            our scaling equations&#8212;and several technical challenges. These challenges led us to create an 
                            entirely new wing of the Archive. Technical development began in late summer 2001 and was 
                            completed in early winter 2002 with the publication of water color illustrations to the Book of 
                            Job in February 2002. Work completed during that time laid a foundation for the publication of a 
                            broad range of new materials, including a set of Blake's engraved <i>Illustrations of the Book of 
                                  Job</i>; manuscripts associated with Blake's illustrations to Milton's "L'Allegro" and "Il Penseroso"; 
                            commercial book illustrations designed by Blake to Robert Blair's <i>The Grave</i>; and water color 
                            illustrations to Milton's "On the Morning of Christ's Nativity" and <i>Paradise Regained</i>. These 
                            were published in our new preview mode, devised in the interest of publishing the greatest 
                            number of high quality images in the shortest span of time. Like all other items in the Archive, 
                            works in preview are in full and accurate color, with enlargements, and with searchable 
                            transcriptions of any texts, including even the briefest of inscriptions. The only functions 
                            unavailable in preview are image search and Inote.</p>
                      
                      <p>Meanwhile, we published additional copies of illuminated books in order to clear another hurdle: after publishing one copy of every illuminated book (in 2003 with the 100-plate <i>Jerusalem</i> copy E), to publish at least one copy of every <i>printing</i> of every book. We added <i>America</i> copy O; <i>Europe</i> copy K; <i>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</i> copy G; <i>Visions of the Daughters of Albion</i> copy P; and <i>The [First] Book of Urizen</i> copies A, B, C, and F. We also added a biography, glossary, and chronology in a new wing of the Archive, <a href="staticpage/biography" target="_blank">About Blake</a>. The biography, by Denise Vultee with the editors, offers extensive background information on Blake's life and works with over 100 accompanying illustrations. The glossary, by Alexander S. Gourlay, treats terms, names, and concepts in Blake that can be mystifying. The chronology covers important dates in Blake's life, including publications and places of residence. The biography and glossary were both encoded in XML to assure conformity with the rest of the Archive. Additionally, we loaded all the data from our image-production records into a new database in order to track our workflow as the Archive expanded.</p>
                      
                      <p>By the end of 2003 the Archive had incorporated a full range of drawings, paintings, and prints from a rapidly expanding circle of 19 international collections. We had acquired for publication 4415 images, including at least one copy of every illuminated book and in many cases multiple copies, as well as a large number of Blake's paintings, drawings, engravings, manuscripts, and typographical works. Three labor-intensive years of final design work, scanning, encoding, and acquisition of new materials helped to ensure the success of the Archive as originally conceived. In 2003 the Archive received the MLA's Prize for a Distinguished Scholarly Edition, the first time the prize was awarded to a digital edition.</p>
                      
                      <p><strong>Phase three, 2004-09</strong>: In expanding beyond the illuminated books, we have generally been guided by the following priorities: original works in coherent series that are closely related to the illuminated books already present in the Archive, individual items closely related to those works in turn, works in significant subcategories where we can provide a large and representative sample, the commercial prints (separate and in series, first those designed and engraved by Blake, then those designed by Blake, followed finally by those engraved by Blake), manuscripts (such as letters, unpublished drafts, and Blake's Notebook), and typographical works.</p>
                      
                      <p>This approach&#8212;expanding coherently from the core outward&#8212;dominated the first phase of our 
                            development and has continued to dominate subsequent phases, as it must if we are to maximize 
                            the usefulness of the Archive to students and scholars. We stress, however, that this pattern of 
                            growth, useful as it is, has not been adopted out of any sense that the illuminated books are 
                            primary and the remaining work secondary. Far from it: one of our major goals is to contribute to 
                            a reassessment of such conventional assumptions. In the past, what has counted as primary or 
                            secondary among art historians and literary critics has depended far too heavily on the very 
                            restrictions (of access, of disciplinary perspective) that we want to reduce if not eliminate in the 
                            name of a fuller understanding. The new means of access we have provided, such as powerful 
                            image-searching capabilities, are most valuable to users when searches are conducted across 
                            related bodies of material. In emphasizing that kind of breadth, we are not ignoring the 
                            competing criterion of representativeness&#8212;and the tension between depth and breadth can be 
                            productive. We believe that our approach stands the best chance of serving both needs at once. 
                            That is, the Archive will steadily become more representative as it becomes more extensive but 
                            at the least possible sacrifice of utilitarian coherence. We are always aware of the dangers of 
                            mere sampling, however extensive, perhaps because the World Wide Web itself offers so many 
                            unsettling object lessons.</p>
                      
                      <p>The third phase of development consolidated and significantly extended the earlier work, expanded the number of contributing collections to 27 and the number of digital images to nearly 6000, added contextual materials, completed a lengthy but necessary conversion of the site from SGML to XML, and set a rigorous publication schedule. We moved to a new base of operations at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and established a manuscript team at the University of Rochester and a close working relationship with Rochester's <i>Blake/An Illustrated Quarterly</i>. In 2005 the Modern Language Association's Committee on Scholarly Editions awarded its Approved Edition seal to the Archive, the first time a digital scholarly edition received this recognition.</p>
                      
                      <p>The slow, painful conversion from SGML to XML permitted fundamental changes in site architecture to provide more flexible and sustainable support for the comprehensive Archive we envisioned. In 2006 we launched our XML-based Archive. The conversion involved essential upgrades in technology, an important shift to open source software, and a conceptual shift in our organization of Blake's works. Our experiences with Blake's engravings, color prints, water colors, and manuscripts led us to reconsider our use of "non-illuminated works" as an overarching category to describe works other than illuminated books. We established a new organizational framework that gives equal weight to various genres and media within Blake's body of work. On the technical end, our new XML-based Archive replaced the SGML and DynaWeb-based architecture that had disseminated the Archive for several years. All works in the Archive (as well as the editors' bibliographic commentary and illustration descriptions) were encoded in XML and stored in a native XML database powered by eXist. A complex set of XSLT stylesheets transformed these XML documents into the HTML that is then accessed by users, delivered by the Apache Cocoon Web development framework (see <a href="staticpage/archiveataglance?p=techsummary" target="_blank">Technical Summary</a>).</p>
                      
                      <p>In 2006 the Archive moved its base of operations from IATH at the University of Virginia to the Carolina Digital Library and Archives (CDLA) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. This move provided far greater scope for our work. Previously we had to alternate between technical and editorial challenges, and changes registered slowly. UNC provided the resources to move forward on all fronts simultaneously.</p>
                      
                      <p>That change in pace and scope allowed us to contemplate major changes in site design and to 
                            establish an ambitious publication schedule that could be rigorously mapped out well in advance. 
                            Publication highlights in this period included Blake's striking series of experimental color printed 
                            drawings; his water color illustrations to Thomas Gray's poems, Dante's <i>Divine Comedy</i> (102 
                            drawings dispersed among seven institutions), and the poetry of John Milton; a sketchbook 
                            containing drawings for the engraved <i>Illustrations of the Book of Job</i>; a manuscript listing the 
                            order of the <i>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</i>; engraved illustrations to Edward Young's 
                            <i>Night Thoughts</i>; and engravings in John Gabriel Stedman's <i>Narrative, of a Five Years' 
                                  Expedition, against the Revolted Negroes of Surinam</i>. The single most telling publication may be 
                            Blake's 20 water color drawings for Robert Blair's poem <i>The Grave</i>, 19 of which disappeared 
                            between their auction in 1836, their dramatic rediscovery in 2001, and their subsequent resale as 
                            individual drawings to several public and private collections. Our scholarly edition of the <i>Grave</i> 
                            water colors thus provides not only a means of integrated access to works that will be 
                            inaccessible as a group of originals for the foreseeable future but also access to a growing body 
                            of related works, such as the engravings (by Blake and Schiavonetti) based on the water colors.</p>
                      
                      <p>We published numerous significant copies of the illuminated books during this period: <i>America</i> copies F and M;  <i>Europe</i> copy H;  <i>The Song of Los</i> copies A, C, D, and E;  <i>Visions of the Daughters of Albion</i> copies A, B, and O and proof copy a;  <i>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</i> copies A, B, T, V, and Y;  <i>The [First] Book of Urizen</i> copy D;  <i>Milton a Poem</i> copies A and B;  <i>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</i> copies K, L, and M; and  <i>The Book of Thel</i> copies L and R.</p>
                      
                      <p>We continued to augment and refine our contextual materials. The <a href="staticpage/biography" target="_blank">About Blake</a> section expanded to include Joseph Viscomi's "Illuminated Printing," which originally appeared in <i>The Cambridge Companion to William Blake</i> (2003). This digital version features additional images that enhance the analysis of Blake's innovative printing techniques. We revised <a href="staticpage/archiveataglance?p=editorialprinciples" target="_blank">Editorial Principles</a> in <a href="staticpage/archiveataglance" target="_blank">About the Archive</a> and published redesigned and updated bibliographies and collection lists in our <a href="staticpage/generalbib" target="_blank">Resources for Further Research</a> section. These resources allow easy access to information about Blake, his works, and Blake holdings in major collections. In <a href="??????">2011</a>, Blake scholar Mark Crosby (Queen's University Belfast, since 2012 Kansas State University) became our official bibliographer.</p>
                      
                      <p>In its inaugural years, the Archive's new manuscript team at the University of Rochester, beginning in 2007, updated many documents in the Archive, but the team's efforts focused on a problematic category of Blake's work, manuscripts and typographical works, for which we have developed and tested a compact XML tagset derived from version P5 of the <a href="http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/" target="_blank">Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) Guidelines</a>. This tagset allows concise but detailed markup of manuscript features such as cancellations, additions, and substitutions.</p>
                      
                      <p>To ensure that manuscripts are fully searchable, we use additional TEI elements (&#60;choice&#62;, &#60;orig&#62;, and &#60;reg&#62;) to regularize abbreviations and unconventional spellings. We have also developed a highly legible color-coding system capable of displaying at a glance most features of Blake's manuscript revisions without the clutter of other symbols &#8212; reserving editors' notes for special cases.</p>
                      
                      <p>Rochester also launched a second initiative, the incorporation of <a href="http://blake.lib.rochester.edu/blakeojs/index.php/blake" target="_blank"><i>Blake/An Illustrated Quarterly</i></a> (1968-present) into the Archive, to give scholars an unprecedented fusion of cross-searchable "primary" (editorial) and "secondary" (critical) scholarship. After two years of preliminary research and consultation, we produced a plan for publication that draws on the open-source XML tagsets created by <i>Digital Humanities Quarterly</i> and such impressive e-journal prototypes as <a href="http://digitalhumanities.org/dhq/" target="_blank"><i>DHQ</i></a>, <a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/research/tateresearch/tatepapers/" target="_blank"><i>Tate Papers</i></a>, and <a href="http://www.ravon.umontreal.ca/"" target="_blank"><i>RaVoN</i></a> (formerly <i>RoN</i>).</p>

                            <p>The Archive's first phase was defined by three goals: to design and construct the foundations of a searchable, SGML-encoded Archive; to acquire major works, mostly illuminated books, from major collections required for the basic structure of the Archive; and to place in the Archive, fully marked up and publicly accessible free on the Web, at least one copy of each illuminated book. We achieved the last of these goals in 2003 with the publication of <i>Jerusalem</i>. In our second phase, we accomplished the subsequent goal of placing multiple copies of illuminated books in the Archive whenever possible, with the focus on those copies that represent different printings of each book. We continued this expansion during the third phase. Since books printed in the same session can differ significantly &#8212; with important variants in coloring, motifs, arrangements, etc. &#8212; we have included multiple copies of books from the same printing as well as those from different printings. The public's exposure to Blake &#8212; including many advanced students and not a few scholars &#8212; has been narrowly restricted to a small number of items that have been too frequently reproduced, such as <i>Songs of Innocence</i> copy B. We shall continue to acquire and incorporate copies never before reproduced or poorly reproduced &#8212; a category that unfortunately includes all but a very few of the books &#8212; thereby making rare and unique material widely accessible, in many cases for the first time. By mid-2010 the Archive had published digital editions of 75 copies of Blake's 19 illuminated works. (Explanatory updates for all publications are available; see <a href="staticpage/update?p=all-updates" target="_blank">Blake Archive Updates</a>.)</p> 
                            
                            <p>But the preoccupations of our day-to-day work shifted in the second and third phases to works in other categories: prints of various kinds, drawings, paintings, manuscripts, and typographical works. We began phase two with a large number of transparencies from these categories&#8212;about 750 ready to be digitized, corrected, marked up, and placed in the Archive at an appropriate time. To this number, we added over 2000 transparencies and digital images of illuminated and non-illuminated works from nine collections, including 1263 from the British Museum (the world's largest Blake collection), and the entire Blake collections of the Fogg Art Museum; the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; the National Gallery of Art, Washington; the National Gallery of Victoria; the Metropolitan Museum of Art; the Birmingham Museums and Art Gallery; the Victoria and Albert Museum; and the Whitworth Art Gallery&#8212;far more than we initially anticipated. At the end of our third phase, we had published 25 scholarly editions of non-illuminated works representing each of the categories listed above and added approximately 400 more images of works from all categories. We begin phase four with nearly 6000 images from 27 contributing collections&#8212;all the major Blake collections in the world. We hoped to acquire another 500 or more images over the next five years. Archive editions were, as always, published in the context of full bibliographic information about each work, scrupulous diplomatic transcriptions of all texts, detailed descriptions of all images, and extensive bibliographies.</p>
                            

<p><strong>Phase four, 2009-16</strong>: A Scholarly Editions and Translations Grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities supported three years&#8212;2010-13&#8212;of planning and development defined by five goals that would bring us closer to the founding vision of the Archive.</p>

<img style="display:block;margin:auto;" src="images/plan3.jpg"/>

<p><strong>Goal 1: Design and implement a redesigned user interface with useful and unprecedented features, including a tool for linking related works in the Archive and a virtual lightbox to enable advanced image manipulation.</strong>  During the first and second years of the grant period the Archive made major design improvements that added functionality to our digital editions. The <strong>virtual group</strong> feature allows for the publication of series of individual works&#8212;for example, the 64 water color drawings and 24 tempera paintings illustrating the Bible that were published during the grant period. The <strong>related works</strong> feature supplements the existing <strong>compare</strong> feature by allowing works related by motif but not by virtue of their physical matrix (medium, for example) to be linked across the Archive. This feature allows users to delve more deeply into Blake’s iconography&#8212;or instance by viewing Blake’s various water color representations of the Old Testament event known as “The Creation of Eve.”</p>

<p>The ability to compare Blake’s visual motifs drove the second of our major additions to the Archive’s functionality: the virtual lightbox launched at the beginning of 2011. The lightbox replaced the Archive’s Inote feature, in place since 1997.  In addition to allowing users to view images alongside their illustration descriptions (as Inote had done), the lightbox incorporated the features of a basic image editor, allowing users to import images from any digital edition in the Archive and to crop, zoom, and rotate those images for easy comparison and study. In keeping with the Archive’s commitment to open-source development principles, the lightbox is a software application whose code can be adopted by any digital humanities developer or project team.</p>

<p><strong>Goal 2: Move Blake’s unique manuscripts and rare typographical works from early development into our normal production schedule</strong>.  The Archive’s manuscript team at the University of Rochester completed a number of projects over the course of the grant period and began others. In order to publish digital editions of Blake’s manuscripts and typographic works, the UR team first had to develop an XML tagset that could adequately describe such works (which had never been published in the Archive before). In conjunction with an XML tagset customized for Blake’s manuscripts, the team also developed a color-coded transcription display designed to help readers make sense of Blake’s sometimes complex revisions. After 2010, the Archive published several important manuscripts created by the Rochester team, including <i>An Island in the Moon, The Pickering Manuscript,</i> 21 of Blake’s letters&#8212;the first installment of several since&#8212;and the historically important inscriptions on the mounts of <i>Europe a Prophecy</i> copy D. Manuscript markup was completed for several others. The Rochester group also initiated transcriptions of Blake’s typographical editions, such as Blake’s only book of conventionally printed poetry, <i>Poetical Sketches</i>,  and <i>A Descriptive Catalogue</i> printed to accompany his exhibition of 1809.</p>

<p>It also became more apparent than ever that, although the Archive had a basic and functional system for manuscript encoding, future digital editions of more complicated manuscripts, such as Blake’s Notebook and his very complex <i>Four Zoas</i> manuscript, would require considerable expansion and adjustment of the tagset. The Rochester staff began this expansion process as they continued working through these complex manuscripts, creating staged prototypes that they presented at conferences and symposia. It became clear as never before that different forms present different, and sometimes difficult, problems that have never been satisfactorily solved, calling for unprecedented approaches.  The works that Blake annotated, for example, such as Joshua Reynolds’s <i>Discourses</i> and Lavater’s <i>Aphorisms</i>, are interactions between two authors in two media, letterpress type and handwritten script, executed at different times and places.  Devising adequate editorial representation of these interactions can be difficult.</p>

<p><strong>Goal 3: Acquire a range of new images.</strong>  During this period the Archive launched a major acquisitions campaign. In 2010-13 we acquired 678 images of Blake’s work from 21 different institutions, including 15 institutions whose collections had never been represented in the Archive. By this time, through a combination of NEH funds and monies from private donors, the Archive had obtained digital images from every major Blake collection in the world.</p>

<p><strong>Goal 4: Describe and encode all Archive images to make image searches function across all genres and media.</strong>  A major goal of the grant period was to move all works in the Archive from <strong>preview mode</strong> to <strong>full mode.</strong> Works published in preview mode include all of the Archive’s scholarly apparatus (including full diplomatic transcriptions, editors’ notes, and repository information) except illustration descriptions that enable searches on the content of images; thus, works in preview mode are not searchable by image motif. Before works can be republished in full mode, we must create full and unique illustration descriptions for each image, a painstaking process that uses the Archive’s uniquely developed image description vocabulary. During the grant period many such descriptions were created, including, for example,</p>

<ul>
    <li>9 illuminated books</li>
    <li>64 water colors illustrating the Bible</li>
    <li>24 tempera paintings illustrating the Bible</li>
    <li>5 color printed drawings</li>
    <li>7 series of commercial book engravings</li>
    <li>3 series of water color and monochrome wash drawings, including 537 water color illustrations to Edward Young's <i>Night Thoughts</i></li>
</ul>

<p>The preparation of Blake’s <i>Night Thoughts</i> water colors for publication was a particularly significant accomplishment. His hundreds of illustrations to Edward Young’s long and popular poem represent a third of Blake’s entire pictorial output.  By 2016 illustration descriptions had been completed for every work in the Archive.</p>

<img style="display:block;margin:auto;" src="images/plan4.jpg"/>

<p><strong>Goal 5: Digitize back issues of Blake/An Illustrated Quarterly and integrate them into the Archive.</strong>  During the grant period 40 years of <i>BIQ</i> were scanned, digitized, double-checked for accuracy, and tagged with an Archive-specific XML tagset devised by our then-technical editor, Will Shaw. Once this work was completed, the Archive’s technical consultant Joseph Ryan and graduate assistant Adam McCune began building the display and search protocols necessary to integrate the newly created <i>BIQ</i> XML with the Archive’s existing XML source code. Blake Archive graduate assistants Jennifer Park and Adair Rispoli simultaneously undertook the painstaking task of replacing the quarterly’s print-quality halftone images, whenever possible, with the Archive’s full-color, high-resolution digital images. The integration of <i>BIQ</i> back issues into the Archive combines two of the world’s most respected sources for Blake scholarship in one online resource that remains free of charge to users. We began publishing back issues of the <i>Quarterly</i> in the first year following the grant period.  In the long run, once the first four decades of back issues are published, the movement of issues from the quarterly’s subscription-based site (blakequarterly.org) into the Archive will occur annually from volume to volume.</p>

<p>During the grant period, beyond our five main goals, we made other significant changes.</p>

<p><i>Redesigned search engines to improve speed and granularity of text and image searches</i>. In the second year of the grant period the Archive launched, alongside the virtual lightbox, newly redesigned search engines that improved the speed and reliability of both text and image searches, allowing users to take full advantage of the Archive’s minutely detailed illustration descriptions (including those for the republished works listed above).</p>

<p><i>Created an XML viewer to facilitate user access to Archive source code</i>. To make the Archive’s source code even more transparent to users and further the Archive’s commitment to open-source development principles, in 2013 the Archive launched a feature that makes the XML BADs (Blake Archive Documents) for each of our digital editions viewable directly in a user’s browser window.</p>

<p><i>Scheduled regular bimonthly publications</i>. In addition to these improvements the Archive maintained a bimonthly publication schedule throughout the grant period while increasing the number of objects included in each publication. During the three years of the grant the Archive published digital editions of</p>

<ul>
    <li>
11 complete illuminated books</li>
<li>44 water color drawings</li>
	<li>24 tempera paintings </li>
	<li>11 letters</li>
	<li>6 color print drawings</li>
	<li>2 prints in series</li>
<li>	2 series of commercial book engravings</li>
<li>	2 manuscripts
	</li><li>1 separate print

    </li>
</ul>

<p>We also published 8 new handlists of Blake collections around the world and republished the following works, previously in preview mode, in full mode:</p>

<ul>
    
<li>
        9 water color series illustrating the works of John Milton
    </li>
    <li>
       	72 water color drawings and tempera paintings illustrating the Bible 
    </li>
    <li>
    	24 color print drawings
    </li></ul>

<p>During the third year of the grant period the Archive’s UNC office began a new working relationship with the UNC Library Services development group. This relationship has enabled the Archive to undertake ambitious technical improvements that are too time- and labor-intensive for the technical editor to complete singlehandedly.</p>
                            
<p><strong>2013-present</strong>: As the NEH grant period ended, the Archive continued to prepare and publish digital editions of Blake’s works in every medium, maintaining its regular publication schedule as work turned toward a complete redesign of the Archive website. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the University of Rochester pledged continued support for the project. UNC continued to provide support in the form of server hosting and administration; office space and hardware; funding for graduate assistants; and meeting space for the Archive’s annual Blake Camp planning meeting. The University of Rochester provided hardware and technical support in addition to office space and funding for graduate assistants.  The UR team grew from its original core of fewer than five PhD students to more than twice that number, plus highly engaged MA students and undergraduates.  The UR team works collaboratively, often using an “each one teach one” training model for new members of the team, who are quickly immersed in an ongoing encoding and transcription project.  Special teams consider the intellectual and technical issues presented by new forms, such as annotations, letters, receipts, and complex manuscripts.</p>

<p>The Archive had expanded its affiliations during the grant period. The Archive’s Rochester group later developed a collaboration with the university’s Digital Humanities Center, which became the Digital Research Center in a new library-based Humanities Center in the fall of 2016. The library hosts the subscription version of <i>Blake/An Illustrated Quarterly</i> (using the Open Journal Systems platform) and a newly consolidated blog that publishes posts from the Archive and the quarterly.</p>

<p>The Archive continued to maintain relationships with the museums, collectors, and cultural heritage institutions whose collections appear in the Archive. (Twenty-one of these institutions were added during the grant period.) The Archive has pursued negotiations with 29 additional institutions, many never previously affiliated with the Archive. Because the Archive already contains works from all of the world’s major Blake collections, future acquisitions will typically be small (sometimes only 1 or 2 items per collection) but highly significant for Blake studies, since works in smaller collections are those least likely to have been previously reproduced in print. By 2016 the Archive comprised almost 7000 high-resolution digital images of Blake’s illuminated books, paintings, drawings, manuscripts, and engravings, with over 45 of the world’s research libraries and museums contributing images.</p>

<p>Site redesign. The primary project since 2013 has been the redesign of the site. Although, with minor revisions, our present interface has served our users well, a complete overhaul was past due, but it would be, we knew, a daunting task. In 2007 we began the process by mounting on our testing site, for internal review and comment, the draft prototype of a revised interface. We began refining our original ideas as we continued to develop tools and features that can offer users a heightened experience of the Archive's ability to support advanced humanities research.</p>

<p>After intensive collaboration with UNC Libraries and ITS Research Computing, we launched a complete and transformative redesign late in 2016. The redesigned Archive retains all the features of the previous site with vast improvements, making it far easier to access and study Blake’s work across the full range of his visual and literary output.</p>

<p>Under the guidance of the Archive’s editors, the redesign team began architecting the new site in late 2013 and in early 2014 joined with UNC’s Libraries and ITS Research Computing to reconceptualize the public face of the Archive, using tip-of-technology programming languages and aesthetic practices. With its new back end built on the open source object-relational database system PostgreSQL and the search platform Solr, and its front end composed in the AngularJS framework, fit for dynamic views demanded by the complexities of Blake's works, the Archive aimed to set a gold standard for digital humanities project design. (See <a href="staticpage/archiveataglance?p=techsummary" target="_blank">Technical Summary</a> for further details.)</p>

<p>The Archive’s redesign team was led by co-editor Joseph Viscomi and comprised Consultant on Special Projects (and former Project Manager) Ashley Reed, Managing Editor Joseph Fletcher, and Technical Editor Michael Fox, who as system architect designed the new front and back end, and contributed programming. Frank Yonnetti at DesignHammer implemented the foundation of the interface. Assistant Project Manager Grant Glass joined the team in 2016. Further programming and financial support came from Chris Kielt, UNC’s Vice Chancellor and CIO, and Mike Barker, Assistant Vice Chancellor of Research Computing, who collaborated with a team from UNC Libraries, led by Associate University Librarian for Digital Strategies and Information Technology Timothy J. Shearer, to assist the Archive in realizing the new design. Nathan Rice, from Research Computing, and Luke Aeschleman, from the libraries, provided vital programming and web design assistance. The Rochester team reviewed the redesign in progress at various key points, contributed revisions of key top-level (“static”) pages, and assisted in testing the beta and near-alpha versions.</p>

<img style="display:block;margin:auto;" src="images/plan5.jpg"/>

<p>The redesigned Archive is faster and easier to navigate, aesthetically more appealing, and offers a more robust search feature. Users can access color corrected digital images of Blake’s works at their true size, as well as enlarge and rotate images to view details of text or illustration. Digital images are accompanied, as always, by diplomatic transcriptions, editors’ notes, and detailed illustration descriptions that make it possible to search Blake’s works for visual motifs. The Archive also provides full and easily accessible bibliographic and provenance information for each digital edition. Though the redesigned Archive retains its focus on the material conditions of Blake’s art, presenting images in the context of works and copies (such as <i>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</i>, copy B), the newly designed site contextualizes each work, copy, and object through a network of relations. Users of the site can now view each Blake object alongside objects in the same copy, objects printed from the same matrix, objects from the same production sequence, and objects with similar designs. This deep contextualization enables comparisons across time, medium, and genre and foregrounds both the immense variety and the recurring themes of Blake’s art.</p>

<p>By the close of 2016 the Archive had published 134 fully searchable and scalable digital editions of Blake’s works in all genres, all but the 1970s decade of back issues of <i>Blake/An Illustrated Quarterly</i> (1967&#8211;present), and a redesigned version of David V. Erdman’s standard print edition, <i>The Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake</i>.</p>

<p><strong>The Archive as scholarly resource</strong>: The Archive’s impact on the field of Blake studies is considerable. The Archive has reached a point in its development at which the number and quality of digital editions available and the scholarly tools that accompany them are enabling new directions and discoveries in Blake scholarship that would have been nearly impossible before the Archive’s launch. Works that were previously only available to scholars through expensive on-site visits, and difficult to study comparatively because of their geographic dispersal, can now be examined in minute detail with only a browser and an internet connection. This has enabled new kinds of Blake scholarship that were not possible when scholars were restricted to visiting far-flung Blake collections or utilizing rare and expensive facsimile editions that reproduced only a single work or copy at a time.</p>

<p>Since its inception, evidence of the use of the Archive to sustain serious scholarship &#8212; our stated objective &#8212; —as continued to accumulate. For scholars, publishers, and others, the Archive has increasingly become a standard source of images and transcriptions of Blake's works for republication. In his multimedia essay "Golgonooza Text" (2005), Nelson Hilton calls the Archive "an indispensable resource without which this presentation &#8212; for one example &#8212; could not exist" (par. 5). Thomas Pfau ties his discussion of <i>The [First] Book of Urizen</i> to our digital edition of copy G in his book <i>Romantic Moods: Paranoia, Trauma, and Melancholy, 1790&#8211;1840</i> (2005). And the second Norton Critical Edition of Blake's works (2008) uses the Archive's transcriptions of the illuminated works and reproduces images provided by the Archive (see <a href="staticpage/archiveataglance?p=articlesindex" target="_blank">Articles about the Archive</a>). Many other digital and print publications draw on the Archive for their texts and images from Blake’s work.</p>

<p>The Archive has created new opportunities for scholarly discoveries. Two definitive essays on Blake's "color printing" &#8212; Robert Essick and Joseph Viscomi's "An Inquiry into Blake's Method of Color Printing" and "Blake's Method of Color Printing: Some Responses and Further Observations," in <i>Blake/An Illustrated Quarterly</i> (winter 2002 and fall 2002, respectively) &#8212; would have been unimaginable without the array of evidence from the Archive images. In the ensuing debate about Blake's methods, Blake scholars Michael Phillips and Martin Butlin responded to these findings in the fall 2002 issue of the quarterly. The following year, Essick and Rosamund A. Paice announced, in the spring 2003 quarterly, nine previously unknown drawings discovered in the British Museum by the Archive editors when they photographed its collection. The number of articles on the Archive project itself continues to increase (see <a href="staticpage/archiveataglance?p=articlesindex" target="_blank">Articles about the Archive</a>).</p>

<p>The Archive's technical significance is signaled by the first dissertation inspired by the Archive, Vladimir Misic's "Mixed Raster Content for Processing of Colored Engravings" (Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Rochester, 2003). The dissertation involved active collaboration with Xerox Corporation. Rob Buckley of Xerox presented a paper on the subject, "Document Imaging on the Web with MRC [Mult-Raster Content, a Xerox technology] and JPEG 2000," at the invitation-only EVA (Digital Imaging and the Visual Arts) Harvard Symposium, October 2&#8211;3, 2002.</p>

<p>The Archive’s significance has been publicly acknowledged in a variety of ways.</p> 
      
      <p><a href="http://edsitement.neh.gov/" target="_blank">EDSITEment</a> &#8212; which, under the auspices of the NEH and affiliated organizations, assesses and compiles online humanities resources &#8212; has named the Archive one of the "Best of the Humanities on the Web" in its Literature and Language Arts category. The Archive was also selected as "a groundbreaking hypermedia project" in the humanities by the <a href="http://www.cbi.umn.edu/" target="_blank">Charles Babbage Institute</a>, the foremost archive for scholarly internet sites, which has acquired the Archive's early project records (1995&#8211;2002) for future study by scholars interested in the history of information technology. When the Archive received the 2003 Prize for a Distinguished Scholarly Edition by the Modern Language Association, the selection committee's citation affirmed that "the William Blake Archive has set a high mark for future editorial practice through its clarity, user-friendliness, beauty, and erudition." In 2005, the Archive became the first digital scholarly edition to receive the Approved Edition seal from the Modern Language Association's Committee on Scholarly Editions.

<p><b>Dissemination</b>: The full resources of the Archive are available to all who can access it via the World Wide Web. We are committed to the continued development and maintenance of a free site, for reasons we have outlined. From the start we have encouraged feedback from users via an e-mail link (we routinely respond to inquiries and comments). By filling out a form at the site itself, users can also subscribe to Blake Archive Updates and automatically receive e-mail notices with the latest information. These notices are regularly posted to several online discussion groups as well.</p>

<p>One of the foremost advantages of digital publication is the ability of the medium to accommodate growth and change. In one sense, then, a final product and date of publication never arrive, at least not as they do in the world of print. That said, the Archive has expanded very nearly to its full intended shape. The intricate software architecture required to integrate and display the full range of Blake's works in all media has been developed, and the Archive contains objects from each category of Blake's works.</p>

<p>Since moving to the University of North Carolina, we have increased the number of publications per year from four to eight. Beyond the Archive itself, we disseminate our findings in lectures, conferences, and published reports (see <a href="staticpage/update?p=presentations" target="_blank">Presentations and Demonstrations about the Archive</a>). The Archive is a frequent subject in discussions of humanities computing, editorial theory and method, and the future of scholarly communication. We increase our outreach through participation in discipline-based organizations, such as the MLA's Committee on Scholarly Editions, and in initiatives such as <a hrfe="http://www.nines.org/">NINES</a>.</p>

<p>Because the Blake Archive has become a central scholarly resource, we have recognized our role as a liaison among scholars, institutions, and private collectors. Scholars needing the best reproductions and texts for their own published research now come to us frequently, and, in cooperation with our contributing collections, we supply their needs whenever possible. Incorporating the journal of record in Blake studies, <a href="http://blake.lib.rochester.edu/blakeojs/index.php/blake" target="_blank"><i>Blake/An Illustrated Quarterly</i></a>, into the Archive further strengthens the circuit of scholarly communication in our field. Altogether, this augmented William Blake Archive aims to realize our original vision by setting a new standard of accessibility to a vast array of visual and textual materials that are central to a grasp of the art and literature of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.</p>
