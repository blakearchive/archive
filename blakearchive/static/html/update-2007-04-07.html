      <p>
      4 April 2007
      <P>
        The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of electronic editions of copies A and B of <i>Songs of Innocence 
          and of Experience</i>, both in the British Museum. Copy B is here reproduced in color for the first time, and, like all the 
        illuminated books in the Archive, the texts and images of both copies are fully searchable and are supported by our Inote and 
        ImageSizer applications.
        <P>
          <i>Songs</i> copy B is one of the first copies of the combined <i>Songs</i>. Along with copies C, previously published in the 
          Archive (see the update for <a href="update-399.html">9 March 1999</a>), D, and E (forthcoming), it was formed in 1794 of 
          <i>Innocence</i> plates printed in raw sienna on both sides of the leaf in 1789 and <i>Experience</i> plates lightly color 
          printed in yellow ochre in the same format in 1794. By this time, Blake had decided to move plates 34-36 ("The Little Girl Lost" 
          and "The Little Girl Found") from <i>Innocence</i> to <i>Experience</i>, but since plate 34 was printed on the verso of the leaf 
          with plate 26 ("A Dream"), plate 26, another <i>Innocence</i> poem, is placed in this copy, as well as in copies C and D, in the 
          <i>Experience</i> section.  And, like copies C and D, copy B is missing plate 52 ("To Tirzah") but has the small vignette known as 
          plate a (five cherubs and an adult male), one of Blake's earliest relief etchings used here as a tailpiece.
          <P>
            Blake printed copy A in 1795 on large sheets of I. TAYLOR paper along with copy R, previously published in the Archive (see the 
            update for <a href="update-1299.html">14 December 1999</a>). This was the first time that Blake printed the <i>Innocence</i> and 
            <i>Experience</i> plates in the same session and printed plates 34-36 as <i>Experience</i> plates. Nevertheless, he apparently meant 
            for the two sections to form separate works. He did not print the combined title plate, printed <i>Innocence</i> in grayish black 
            ink and <i>Experience</i> in an olivish light black ink, and stabbed and numbered the two parts as separate volumes. Copy A was 
            produced as part of a set of illuminated books printed on large paper, approximately 38 x 27 cm, 
            and joins other works from the 
            large-paper set now in the Archive (<i>All Religions are One</i> copy A, <i>There is No Natural Religion</i> copy L, <i>The Book of 
              Thel</i> copy F, <i>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</i> copy D, <i>Visions of the Daughters of Albion</i> copy G, <i>America, a 
                Prophecy</i> copy A, <i>Europe, a Prophecy</i> copy H, <i>Songs</i> copy R, <i>The First Book of Urizen</i> copy B).
