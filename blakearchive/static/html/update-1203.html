      <!--<h2 class="title">William Blake Archive Update</h2>-->
      <p>18 December 2003</p>
      
      
      <p>The William Blake Archive <!--<www.blakearchive.org>--> is pleased to
        announce the publication of electronic editions of Blake's illustrations to
        two of John Milton's poems, the ode "On the Morning of Christ's Nativity" and
        <i>Paradise Regained</i>. Both are presented in our Preview mode, one that
        provides all the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (our
        image annotation program). These two sets of water colors join the twelve
        illustrations to Milton's "L'Allegro" and "Il Penseroso" previously
        published. They can be found in the Archive by moving through the following
        categories: Works in the Archive, Non-Illuminated Materials, Drawings and
        Paintings, and Water Color Drawings.</p>
      
      
      <p>The six illustrations to the "Nativity Ode" presented here are the set
        commissioned by the Rev. Joseph Thomas in 1809. These are now in the
        Whitworth Art Gallery, University of Manchester; a second set, acquired by
        Thomas Butts c. 1815, is in the Huntington Library. This later set will be
        published in the Archive next year. The twelve illustrations to <i>Paradise
          Regained</i> may have been commissioned by Butts c. 1816-20, but were
        acquired directly from Blake by John Linnell in 1825. Both series show
        Blake's close reading of Milton's poetry, but a stylistic comparison between
        them reveals Blake's development as a water colorist from relatively broad,
        flat washes, typical of his work in the first decade of the nineteenth
        century, to his mature style characterized by detailed modeling and
        stipple-like brushwork.</p>
      
      
      <p>We are also pleased to announce that the Archive is this year's recipient
        of the Prize for a Distinguished Scholarly Edition, awarded every two years
        by the Modern Language Association. This is the first time that the award has
        been given to an electronic edition.</p>
      
      
      <p>As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access
        restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible
        through the continuing support of the Library of Congress, the Institute for
        Advanced Technology in the Humanities at the University of Virginia, by a
        major grant from the Preservation and Access Division of the National
        Endowment for the Humanities, by the University of North Carolina at Chapel
        Hill, and by the cooperation of the international array of libraries and
        museums that have generously given us permission to reproduce works from
        their collections in the Archive.</p>
