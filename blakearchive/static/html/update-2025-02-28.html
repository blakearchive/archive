The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of digital editions of <a href="work/abel" target="_blank"><i>The Ghost of Abel</i> Copy C</a>, from the Huntington Library and Art Gallery, and <a href="work/homer" target="_blank"><i>On Homers Poetry [and] On Virgil</i> Copy A</a>, from the National Gallery of Art. Both produced in 1822, they are among Blake’s final illuminated books. 
</p>
<p>
A drama in miniature, <i>The Ghost of Abel</i> addresses "Lord Byron in the Wilderness" (Plate 1), whose <i>Cain, a Mystery</i> appeared in 1821. It treats the themes of revenge, atonement, forgiveness, and self-annihilation through the reactions of Adam, Eve, Satan, and Jehovah to the first murder. The broadsheet <i>On Homers Poetry [and] On Virgil</i> challenges these representative figures of classical learning. The first of these two tractates on a single plate offers an anti-classical perspective on morality and concepts of unity in the arts. The second tractate denounces ancient Greece and Rome as tyrannies promoting war and dominion and destroying the imaginative arts. Together, the tractates emphasize the destructive consequences of imperialism.
</p>
<p>
There are five copies extant for each of these works, which, like most of Blake's illuminated books, were produced in relief etching. They join Copy A of <i>Ghost of Abel</i> and Copies B and F of <i>On Homers Poetry</i> already in the Archive.
