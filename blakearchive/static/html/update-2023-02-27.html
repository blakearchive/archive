The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of <a href="work/laocoon" target="_blank"><i>Laocoön</i></a> Copy A from the Fitzwilliam Museum. This copy joins Copy B, published in the Archive in October 1998.  These are the only extant impressions of this important etching/engraving.

In an inscription beneath his detailed reproduction of the <i>Laocoön</i>, Blake reinterprets the famous Hellenistic sculpture as a copy of an original Hebraic work representing Jehovah and his two sons, Satan and Adam. Other inscriptions surrounding the central design set forth Blake’s interrelated opinions on money, empire, morality, Christianity, and the arts. The central image of the statue may have been executed as early as c. 1815 in connection with Blake’s work on illustrations for Abraham Rees, <i>The Cyclopaedia; or, Universal Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, and Literature</i>. Blake’s careful pencil drawing of the sculptural group, based on a plaster cast in the Royal Academy, Somerset House, can be dated to 1815. <i>Laocoön</i> was not published in <i>The Cyclopaedia</i>, possibly because it was too large to fit into Rees’s volumes, but the copperplate was evidently retained by Blake. The inscribed texts surrounding the statue were almost certainly added at a much later date, c. 1826-27; both impressions were printed at that time. There are very slight differences in inking between the two impressions, but the only significant difference is the absence in Copy A of the small touches of black wash added to Copy B.

<i>Laocoön</i> includes some of Blake’s final, aphoristic statements on topics central to his writings from the 1780s to the end of his life. In his journal of c. 1859-61, John Clark Strange reports on a meeting with Samuel Palmer, one of Blake’s youthful followers in his final years. Palmer showed Strange an impression of <i>Laocoön</i> (possibly Copy B) and commented that, when Blake gave him the print, Blake said “you will find my creed there” (Bentley, <i>Records</i>, page 726).
