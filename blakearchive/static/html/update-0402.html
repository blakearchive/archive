      <!--<h2 class="title">William Blake Archive Update</h2>-->
      <p>3 April 2002</p>
      
      
      <p>The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of
        "Resources for Further Research," a new wing of the Archive. Intended to
        assist students and researchers seeking additional materials for the study of
        Blake, Resources includes collection lists for the Archive's contributing
        institutions and bibliographies of reference and scholarly sources pertaining
        to Blake. In addition, we've moved our electronic edition of David V.
        Erdman's <i>Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake</i> to this new wing.
        Each of these resources is encoded in SGML and fully searchable. In the
        future, Resources will also include a Study Guide for using the Archive to
        explore Blake and his works.</p>
      
      
      <p>The collection lists were prepared by the Archive editors in partnership
        with the curators of the contributing collections. Gathered in a single
        location, these handlists provide the most complete account available today
        of the various collections of Blake's work. The bibliographies were compiled
        by the Archive editors with the assistance of Denise Vultee. These
        bibliographies include a selection of the most important publications written
        in English about Blake and his work and should be considered a starting point
        for students and researchers. We will update the bibliographies on an annual
        basis.</p>
      
      
      <p>At present the Archive contains 41 copies of 18 of Blake's 19 illuminated
        books and the Thomas Butts set of Blake's water colors illustrating the Book
        of Job, now in the Pierpont Morgan Library. In the near future we expect to
        release more drawings and prints in Preview, a much-anticipated electronic
        edition of <i>Jerusalem</i> copy E, and further supplementary materials,
        including a biography and glossary.</p>
      
      
      <p>As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access
        restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible
        through the continuing support of the Institute for Advanced Technology in
        the Humanities at the University of Virginia, by a major grant from the
        Preservation and Access Division of the National Endowment for the
        Humanities, by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and by the
        cooperation of the international array of libraries and museums that have
        generously given us permission to reproduce works from their collections in
        the Archive.</p>
      
      
      <p>We invite you to visit the Archive at <a href="http://www.blakearchive.org">www.blakearchive.org</a> or <a href="http://www.blakearchive.org.uk">www.blakearchive.org.uk</a> (British
