The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of ten of Blake's designs published as commercial book illustrations. Two of these, one plate in Thomas Commins, <a href="work/bb444" target="_blank"><i>An Elegy, Set to Music</i></a> (1786) and one in <a href="work/bb490" target="_blank"><i>Remember Me!</i></a> (1824), were both designed and engraved by Blake. The remaining eight plates were designed by Blake and engraved by other craftsmen. These were published in Gottfried Augustus Burger, <a href="work/bb440" target="_blank"><i>Leonora</i></a> (1796, three plates), Benjamin Heath Malkin, <a href="work/bb482" target="_blank"><i>A Father’s Memoirs of his Child</i></a> (1806, one plate), John Whitaker, <a href="work/bb512" target="_blank"><i>The Seraph</i></a> (c. 1818-1828, one plate), and John Varley, <a href="work/bb501" target="_blank"><i>A Treatise on Zodiacal Physiognomy</i></a> (1828, three plates). With these additions, the Archive now includes all known works by Blake in two categories, Commercial Book Illustrations Designed and Engraved by Blake and Commercial Book Illustrations Designed by Blake and Engraved by Other Engravers.
</p>
<p>
Blake's cover or frontispiece design for Commins's <i>Elegy</i> is one of his earliest commercial book illustrations he both designed and engraved. The survival of five preliminary studies offers the opportunity to trace the evolution of the design through different versions culminating in the engraving. The small but striking "Hiding of Moses" in the annual gift book, <i>Remember Me!</i>, is Blake's last commercial book illustration he both designed and engraved. A proof of the plate, before it was cut down to fit the book's format, is included in the Archive as a Supplemental View.

The plates in the translation of Burger's popular and influential poem, <i>Leonora</i>, include a frontispiece with lines from Edward Young's <i>Night Thoughts</i> engraved below the design, a headpiece to the poem, and a tailpiece. An inscription on the preliminary water color for the tailpiece indicates that Blake believed he would be hired to engrave the illustrations he had designed, but he lined through this inscription when he learned that the commission had been given to another engraver. Blake was confronted with the same disappointment when, in 1805, the publisher Thomas Cromek took from Blake the commission to engrave his <a href="work/bb435" target="_blank">illustrations to Robert Blair's <i>The Grave</i></a>.
</p>
<p>
The framing design in the frontispiece to Malkin's <i>A Father’s Memoirs</i> was initially engraved by Blake, but this was scraped and burnished off the copperplate and an engraving of Blake's design by Thomas Cromek substituted. This unusual history is examined in more detail in the prefatory essay to the Malkin plate. The engraved title page in Whitaker's <i>The Seraph</i>, possibly published after Blake's death, is a copy of one of Blake's engravings illustrating Edward Young's <i>Night Thoughts</i> of 1797.

<p>  
Three plates in Varley's <i>Treatise</i> include imaginary portraits based on Blake's Visionary Heads he drew for Varley and their mutual friend, John Linnell, beginning no later than 1818 in séance-like sessions. These plates, engraved by Linnell, include what is probably a modified self-portrait of Blake and two views of one of the most famous Visionary Heads, "The Ghost of a Flea."
</p>
<p> 
Blake's tempera painting, <a href="work/but653" target="_blank"><i>Sir Jeffery Chaucer and the Nine and Twenty Pilgrims on Their Journey to Canterbury</i></a> has been in the Archive in our "Preview" mode since March 2021. This work has now been fully published, with a complete and searchable description of the design and transcriptions of the texts, including those inscribed on the Tabard Inn.
