      <!--<h2 class="title">What's New in the William Blake Archive</h2>-->
      <p>7 October 2009
        <p/>
        The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of an 
        electronic edition of Blake's ten monochrome wash drawings illustrating 
        Mary Wollstonecraft's <i>Original Stories from Real Life</i> and the first and 
        second editions of the book containing Blake's six engravings of his 
        designs.  The designs and inscribed texts in all three series are fully 
        searchable and are supported by our Inote and ImageSizer applications.
        <p/>
        In 1788, Joseph Johnson published the first edition of Mary 
        Wollstonecraft's morally instructive narrative for children, <i>Original 
          Stories from Real Life; with Conversations, Calculated to Regulate the 
          Affections, and Form the Mind to Truth and Goodness</i>.  A few years later, 
        Johnson decided to issue a new edition, for which he commissioned Blake to 
        prepare a series of illustrations.  Blake's extant drawings, now in the 
        Rosenwald Collection, Library of Congress, are datable to c. 1791.  In 
        addition to these ten designs, Blake must have executed at least one 
        further drawing as a preliminary for his fifth plate; this drawing is 
        untraced.  Six designs were selected for publication in the 1791 edition 
        of Wollstonecraft's book; Blake engraved the designs himself.  The first 
        and second states of Blake's plates appear variously in copies of the 1791 
        edition.  The second edition to contain Blake's plates was published by 
        Johnson in 1796; it contains the third (final) states of Blake's plates. 
        The copy of the 1791 edition now in the Archive is from the Huntington 
        Library; it contains the second states of the plates.  The copy of the 
        1796 edition in the Archive is from the Essick collection and contains the 
        third (final) states of the plates.
        <p/>
        Modern interpreters of the illustrations have detected a pictorial 
        critique of Wollstonecraft's stories.  Blake appears to have found her 
        morality too calculating, rationalistic, and rigid.  He represents 
        Wollstonecraft's spokesperson, Mrs. Mason, as a domineering presence. 
         From Blake's perspective, Mason's acts of charity are excessively 
        condescending and tend to reinforce the underlying social conditions that 
        create disparities between wealth and poverty.  As Blake wrote in "The 
        Human Abstract," "Pity would be no more, / If we did not make somebody 
        Poor."

        With this publication, the Archive adds a new set of scholarly tools. 
        These tools, known collectively as our Related Works system, are designed 
        to show relationships among works and individual objects in the Archive. 
        They function at two levels.  First, work index pages now include active 
        links to related materials in the Archive (for example, a set of 
        preliminary sketches for a group of engravings).  Second, the Show Me menu 
        on object view pages now includes Related Works in the Archive.  Like the work-level menu, this list includes active 
        links to the related objects and is meant to allow study of the related 
        materials side-by-side.  The Wollstonecraft illustrations are the first 
        publication in the Archive to use this feature.
        <p/>
        As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access 
        restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible 
        by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the cooperation of 
        the international array of libraries and museums that have generously 
        given us permission to reproduce works from their collections in the 
        Archive.
