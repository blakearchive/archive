<b>Morris Eaves</b> is co-editor (with
            Morton Paley, University of California, Berkeley) of <a href="http://blake.lib.rochester.edu/blakeojs/index.php/blake"><cite>Blake/An
                  Illustrated Quarterly</cite></a>. In <cite>William Blake's Theory of Art</cite>, <cite>The Counter-Arts
Conspiracy: Art and Industry in the Age of Blake</cite>, and
subsequent essays, he has explored Blake's aesthetics in their
historical contexts, including the histories of visual art, commerce,
and technology. His current project, <cite>Posterity: The Test of Time</cite>,
is a speculative study of editorial theory and practice in terms of the
audience's historical power to preserve, alter, and abandon its objects
of interest. He is <a href="http://www.sas.rochester.edu/eng/people/faculty/eaves_morris/index.html">Professor of English and Richard L. Turner Professor of Humanities at the University of Rochester</a>, where he directs the A. W. Mellon Graduate Program in Digital Humanities.</p>

      <b>Robert N. Essick</b>, a major collector
of Blake's work, has spent much of his career expanding and correcting
the knowledge of Blake as an artist. <cite>William Blake
Printmaker</cite> was the first reliable and comprehensive
account of a fundamental but neglected dimension of Blake's career.
Subsequent writings, such as Essick's catalogues raisonnes of Blake's
separate plates and commercial engravings, have been models of their
kind, not only accurate and complete but also well-informed by the
critical and analytical methods of contemporary art history. He has also written and edited several books about Blake's poetry, including <cite>William Blake and the Language of Adam</cite>. He is Distinguished Professor Emeritus of English Literature, University of California, Riverside.</p>

      <b>Joseph Viscomi's</b> experience as a
printmaker and curator served him well in <cite>Blake and the
Idea of the Book</cite>, a study of the production, editing, and
dating of the illuminated books that overturned much of the
conventional wisdom about Blake's illuminated-book medium. Other
writings on Blake include <a href="http://siteslab.unc.edu/viscomi/frontend_page.html">essays</a> on the evolution of <cite>The
Marriage of Heaven and Hell</cite> and on Blake's market and
            reputation in the mid-nineteenth century. His current project, <cite>Printed Paintings</cite>, is a study of Blake's large color prints, focusing on their technique, history, and meaning. He is the <a href="http://englishcomplit.unc.edu/people/viscomij">James G. Kenan Distinguished Professor</a> of English Literature at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
