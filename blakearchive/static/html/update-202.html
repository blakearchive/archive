      <!--<h2 class="title">William Blake Archive Update</h2>-->
      <p>18 February 2002</p>
      
      
      <p>The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of
        Blake's first group of twenty-one water colors illustrating the Book of Job.
        These were created on commission for Blake's major patron, Thomas Butts, as a
        series of nineteen water colors c. 1805-06; two further designs were added to
        the group at a later date, probably c. 1821-27. While Blake had drawn and
        engraved some important designs based on Job in earlier years, the Butts set
        of water colors is his first attempt to create a pictorial narrative of the
        whole story, from what Blake believed to be Job's misapprehensions about God,
        through Job's torments at the hands of Satan, to the restoration of Job's
        physical and spiritual wellbeing. The later set of Job water colors that
        Blake executed for John Linnell and the famous engraved series were both
        based on this earlier, Butts group.</p>
      
      
      <p>The release of Blake's Job water colors is particularly significant
        because it marks our first publication of Blake's "Non-Illuminated Works."
        This new "wing" of the Archive will gradually be populated with Blake
        engravings, paintings, drawings, manuscripts, and typographic editions. In
        the near future, we will add such important works as the Job engravings and
        water color illustrations to the poetry of John Milton, Thomas Gray, and
        Edward Young.</p>
      
      
      <p>In the interest of publishing the greatest number of high-quality images
        in the shortest span of time, we are introducing to the Archive a new
        "Preview mode." Like the current presentation of Blake's illuminated books in
        the Archive, works in Preview will be in full and accurate color, with
        enlargements, and with searchable transcriptions of any texts, including even
        the briefest of inscriptions. The only functions that will not be available
        in Preview are image search and Inote. Thus, works in Preview will not offer
        descriptions of visual motifs, nor will those visual motifs be searchable.
        The advantage of this slightly reduced mode of display is that we will be
        able to add works to the Archive more expeditiously. All works in Preview
        will bear a clear indication that they are indeed in "Preview," both in all
        relevant tables of contents and on the basic Object View page. As we add many
        works in Preview, we will gradually shift them toward fully functional
        displays that will make image search and Inote available. The Job water
        colors announced here are currently available in Preview mode.</p>
      
      
      <p>At present the Archive contains, in addition to the Job water colors in
        Preview, 41 copies of 18 of Blake's 19 illuminated books, plus a fully
        SGML-encoded electronic edition of David V. Erdman's <i>Complete Poetry and
          Prose of William Blake</i>. In the near future we expect to release more
        drawings and prints in Preview; a much-anticipated electronic edition of
        <i>Jerusalem</i> copy E, fully encoded for image search and Inote; and a
        collection of handlists for each of the Archive's contributing institutions
        as well as improved, searchable versions of our bibliographies. Future
        supplementary materials include a biography and glossary.</p>
      
      
      <p>As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access
        restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible
        through the continuing support of the Institute for Advanced Technology in
        the Humanities at the University of Virginia, by a major grant from the
        Preservation and Access Division of the National Endowment for the
        Humanities, by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and by the
        cooperation of the international array of libraries and museums that have
        generously given us permission to represent works from their collections in
        the Archive.</p>
