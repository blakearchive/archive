      <!--<h2 class="title">William Blake Archive Update</h2>-->
      <p>16 October 1998</p>
      
      
      <p>The editors of the William Blake Archive
        http://www.iath.virginia/edu/blake are pleased to announce the publication of
        four new electronic editions of Blake's illuminated books. They are:</p>
      
      
      <br/><br/>
      
      
      <ul>
        <li><i>The Ghost of Abel</i> copy A (The Library of Congress)</li>
        
        
        <li><i>On Homers Poetry [and] On Virgil</i> copies B (The Fitzwilliam
          Museum) and F (The Pierpont Morgan Library)</li>
        
        
        <li><i>Laocoön</i> copy B (collection of Robert N. Essick)</li>
      </ul>
      
      
      <p>These three works are Blake's final illuminated books, their composition
        dateable between 1822 (<i>The Ghost of Abel</i>, <i>On Homers Poetry [and] On
          Virgil</i>) and c. 1826-27 (<i>Laocoön</i>). In the words of Sir Geoffrey
        Keynes, they offer Blake's "Last Testament" on subjects ranging from
        aesthetic theory to political economy, from forgiveness to apocalyptic
        judgment. A drama in miniature, <i>The Ghost of Abel</i> addresses "Lord
        Byron in the Wilderness" (plate 1) and, more specifically, the issues of
        vengeance and forgiveness raised by Byron's <i>Cain: A Mystery</i> (1821).
        The broadsheet <i>On Homers Poetry [and] On Virgil</i> challenges these
        representative figures of classical learning, with special emphasis on
        concepts of unity as an artistic ideal, identity, and the destructive
        consequences of imperialism. There are five copies extant for each of these
        works, which, like most of Blake's illuminated books, were produced in relief
        etching; the <i>Laocoön</i> plate, which is an intaglio etching/engraving, is
        extant in two copies. Through a careful representation and restoration of the
        famous Hellenistic sculptural group, Blake attempts to return the
        <i>Laocoön</i> to its supposed Hebraic origins and its allegorical meanings,
        revealed by the terse yet intellectually expansive texts with which Blake
        surrounds the central image.</p>
      
      
      <p>All of these editions have newly edited SGML-encoded texts and are all
        fully searchable for both text and images and supported by the unique Inote
        and ImageSizer applications described in our previous updates. We now have
        twenty-six copies of sixteen illuminated books in the Archive. Late this year
        and early in the next, we will add <i>Milton</i> copy D and <i>Jerusalem</i>
        copy E. We will also be adding at least six more copies of <i>Songs of
          Innocence and of Experience</i>, two copies of <i>Songs of Innocence</i>,
        five copies of <i>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</i>, four copies of <i>The
          Book of Urizen</i>, and two copies each of <i>America, a Prophecy</i> and
        <i>Europe, a Prophecy</i>. In addition, by the end of 1998 we will provide a
        fully-searchable SGML edition of David V. Erdman's <i>Complete Poetry and
          Prose of William Blake</i>.</p>
      
      
      <p>In the coming weeks we will also be opening a brand-new wing of the
        Archive, consisting of an extensive array of supporting materials: an updated
        and expanded Plan of the Archive, a statement of Editorial Principles and
        Methodology, a summary of the Archive's technical design and implementation,
        a list of Frequently Asked Questions, an in-depth illustrated Tour
        highlighting the Archive's features and some ways to use its resources, and
        more. Our hope is that these extensive documentary materials will prove
        valuable both to our own growing user community as well as to scholars
        interested in the theory and practice of electronic editing more generally.
        We will make a separate announcement when these materials are available on
        the site.</p>
      
      
      <p>Finally, on our recently opened Contributing Collections page, we plan to
        begin adding color-coded and linked lists of each institution's entire Blake
        collection to indicate what is and is not in the Archive and what is
        forthcoming. In addition to providing a convenient index of the scope and
        contents of the Archive, these lists should also be useful to scholars in
        planning research trips.</p>
