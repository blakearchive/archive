      <!--<h2 class="title">William Blake Archive Update</h2>-->
      <p>February 12, 1998</p>
      
      
      <p>The editors of the William Blake Archive are pleased to announce the
        publication of an electronic edition of <cite>Songs of Innocence and of
          Experience</cite>, copy Z. It joins editions of three copies of <cite>The
            Book of Thel</cite> and two copies of <cite>Visions of the Daughters of
              Albion</cite>. In the next week, these works will be joined by <cite>The
                Marriage of Heaven and Hell</cite>, copy D, <cite>The Book of Urizen</cite>,
        copy G, <cite>America, a Prophecy</cite>, copy E, and <cite>Europe, a
          Prophecy</cite>, copy B. All of these editions have newly edited texts and
        were scanned from 4x5 color transparencies made specifically for the Archive.
        They are all fully searchable for both text and images and are supported by
        the unique Inote and ImageSizer applications described in our <a href="./all-updates.html">previous updates</a>.</p>
      
      
      <p><cite>Urizen</cite> copy G and <cite>Songs</cite> copy Z were produced in
        Blake's late printing and coloring styles, c.1818 and c. 1826 respectively.
        <cite>America</cite> copy E is a monochrome copy from 1793;
        <cite>Europe</cite> copy B was color printed in 1794, and
        <cite>Marriage</cite> copy D was produced in 1795 on large paper and with
        some rudimentary color printing.</p>
      
      
      <p>We will be adding second and third copies of most illuminated books in the
        coming months, with the goal of having the entire illuminated canon online
        later this year. In addition, work continues on the SGML edition of David V.
        Erdman's <cite>Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake</cite>, which we
        anticipate releasing sometime this spring.</p>
