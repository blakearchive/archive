      <!--<h2 class="title">Editorial Principles: Methodology and Standards in the Blake Archive</h2>-->
    
      <p>It makes sense to see the Blake project as an extension
        of ongoing archival, cataloguing, and editorial enterprises into a new
        medium in order to exploit its radical advantages. Until the late
        twentieth century there was no base of knowledge and technology
        sufficient to conceive, much less execute, an adequate comprehensive
        edition of the work of a multimedia artist. The dominant tradition of
        Blake editing has been overwhelmingly literary. The historical Blake, a
        printmaker and painter by training who added poetry to his list of
        accomplishments, has been converted, editorially, into a poet whose
        visual art is acknowledged but moved off to the side where it becomes
        largely invisible, partly because of what one of Blake's first critics,
        the poet Swinburne, called "hard necessity"&mdash;the technological
        and
        economic obstructions that have prevented the reproduction of accurate
        images in printed editions. On the art-historical flank a productive
        scholarly tradition of cataloguing has been complementary to but
        largely disconnected from its editorial counterpart on the literary
        flank. Consequently, many students and even professional scholars know
        either the textual or visual side of Blake's work but not both, despite
        their interconnections at the source. Methodologically, the William
        Blake Archive is an attempt to restore historical balance through the
        syntheses made possible by the electronic medium. We believe that the
        resulting archival editorial prototype can help transform access to the
        art and literature of Blake's era as it helps to transform scholarly
        approaches to Blake. The methodology and the standards
        associated with it are, we believe, in line with this claim.</p>
            <p>The editors have been working on several fronts to
        change the dominant editorial mode. The collective facts and arguments
        of four books, Essick's <i>Separate Plates of William Blake</i>
        (Princeton, 1983) and <i>Blake's Commercial Book Illustrations</i>
        (Oxford, 1991), Eaves's <i>The Counter-Arts Conspiracy: Art and
          Industry in the Age of Blake</i> (Cornell, 1992), and Viscomi's <i>Blake
            and the Idea of the Book</i> (Princeton, 1993) have helped to lay
        the groundwork for the editorial transformation that the electronic
        Blake Archive is designed to accomplish.</p>
     
      <p>In 1993, we made an initial trial of our basic editorial
        principles and procedures in two printed volumes, <i>William
          Blake: The Early Illuminated Books</i> and <i>William
            Blake: "Milton a Poem" and the Final Illuminated Works</i>. Their
        reproductions, based on large-format transparencies, were rigorously
        controlled for color fidelity, and we devised a multi-layered editorial
        apparatus that we thought optimized the presentation of books in which
        graphic and textual elements converge. Some fundamental tenets of the
        editorial approach that we applied to the printed volumes seemed
        precisely correct for the Blake Archive, and we have adopted and
        extended them; others, including the principle of selection, were
        almost inconceivable in print but are within the reach of electronic
        editions.</p>
    
      <p><b>Principles of inclusion:</b> Our printed
        volumes in the Blake Trust series presented the best current
        information about the production of Blake's individual illuminated
        books, drawn chiefly from Viscomi's revisionist scholarship. But in
        those volumes it was not feasible to reproduce more than a single copy
        of each work&mdash;and many of the copies most relevant to the
        history of
        production have never been reproduced. We are building the Archive on
        principles that, while we cannot ignore practical limitations that
        apply to electronic scholarly resources as to any other kind,
        incorporate a history of Blake's artistic production for the first time
        into an edition.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>As we indicate in the Plan
        of the Archive (see Significance), we chose the
        illuminated books as our starting point for several reasons: their
        historical and artistic value, the editorial and technical challenges
        they present, their relative coherence as an extensive group, the
        difficulties that their fragility and their widely dispersed present
        locations have created for scholars, and the need for a new map of
        their place in Blake's lifetime of artistic labor. We saw the
        illuminated books, once we had substantially achieved our first-phase
        goal of including one copy from every printing of every book, as a kind
        of archival and editorial backbone for the project.</p>
      
      <p>That backbone supports a twofold strategy: to evolve
        along lines that will achieve the greatest possible coverage of the
        range of Blake's work while at the same time maintaining the greatest
        possible degree of scholarly coherence. (Maximizing the usefulness of
        our image- and text-searching tools is only one of several good reasons
        for doing so.) We maintain coherence by expanding the core with works
        that are closely related (historically, thematically, physically, etc.)
        <i>to</i> the core, and by giving priority to
        significant interrelated clusters (clustered by medium, such as the
        large color prints of 1795, by subject or theme, such as the Job and
        Milton illustrations in several media, etc.). Whenever possible, we
        assemble these individual clusters into larger ones. Consider, for
        example, Blake's work as a printmaker in several graphic
        media. By expanding outward from the core of the illuminated books
        (typically watercolored relief etchings) to the other works designed
        and engraved by him, and then to those designed by him but engraved by
        others, and finally to those designed by others but engraved by him, we
        aim to maintain coherence while gradually achieving the desired scope.
        We shall also incorporate Blake's typographical works, which
        are all rare or unique.</p>
     
      <p>For details of our plans for expansion, see the Plan
        of the Archive.</p>
    
      <p><b>Fundamental units:</b> The priority that
        we grant to the media, methods, and histories of artistic production
        has dictated a feature of the Archive that influences virtually every
        aspect of it. It is utterly fundamental: we <i>emphasize the
          physical object&mdash;the plate, page, or canvas&mdash;over the
          logical textual
          unit&mdash;the poem or other work abstracted from its physical
          medium</i>.
        This emphasis coincides with our archival as well as with our editorial
        objectives.</p>
   
      <p>Those central principles have too many implications to
        discuss fully here, but suffice it to say that they shape the entire
        editorial strategy, from the underlying structure of the XML
        architecture, to the treatment of texts and pictures, to the user's
        dynamic position among those texts and pictures. The part-to-whole path
        reinforced by print&mdash;which typically starts with a reading of
        Blake's
        "poems" (often, in fact, transcriptions extracted from illuminated
        pages) and may or may not move along to a later, secondary look at
        "illustrations" (which often turn out to be a predetermined editorial
        selection of the pictures that seem most relevant to the
        words)&mdash;is
        reversed.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>Perhaps the best way of describing our methodology is to
        present a brief account of some of its consequences, as they shape the
        choices available. (For a brief pictorial guide
        illustrating the major points in the discussion below, see our .) A
        user looking for a work in the Archive typically moves down through the
        XML hierarchy that is fundamental to the design of the whole. The user
        selects Works from the primary Table of Contents page. From the <i>Works
          in the William Blake Archive</i> page, the user selects a
          category from this comprehensive list:</p>

      <p>The user then proceeds hierarchically to an index of
available works in that category. Selecting a particular <i>work</i>
(say <i>The [First] Book of Urizen</i>) in turn produces
an index of copies available in the Archive (currently six of the eight
existing copies, from five collections). From this "generic work-view"
page the user can link to a bibliography (for the work <i>Urizen</i>)
or to information About the Work, which provides a brief introduction
and a full list of the existing copies of that work and their current
locations.</p>




      
      
      
      <p>Selecting one plate from an index of plates in a copy
of <i>Urizen</i>, the user moves to a reproduction
of the physical object, perhaps plate 2 of copy F, from the Houghton
Library at Harvard. This, the "object view," is the fundamental level
of the Archive, to which all else is oriented. Here we integrate the
reproductions of individual objects into an array of tools and
information sources that allow further investigation of the physical
object itself and of its meanings in context. Each tool and information
source has a designated place within the total scheme, and each is
available to the user by means of a hypertextual link.</p>




      
      
      
      <p>From this point, our object-centered methodology can be
most readily seen in the guidelines and standards we apply to the
editing of texts, the reproduction of pictures, and the informational
contexts that we supply for both, and, finally, in the tools we give
users to create their own information.</p>




      
      
      
      <p><b>Edited texts:</b> Transcriptions of texts
are, in the terms of textual criticism, as "diplomatic" as the medium
allows. That is, in line with the archival dimension of our project,
our texts are conservative transpositions of the original into
conventional type fonts, retaining not only Blake's capitalization,
punctuation, and spelling, but also (for the first time in a complete
edition) an approximation of his page layout. Unlike printed editions
of Blake, which have typically chosen among the textual features of
various copies to produce a single printed text, <i>the texts in
the Archive are specific to individual objects</i>: each
transcription is of a particular page or plate or sheet of drawing
paper in a particular copy and no other. The arrangement and the
contents of Blake's books and other works often vary markedly from copy
to copy, version to version. (<i>The [First] Book of Urizen</i> is
the easiest example&mdash;the arrangement of the plates is
different in
every copy, altering both the order of designs and the narrative
sequences.) In general, printed editions such as Erdman's must not only
extract text from objects that are composites of text and design and
convert them to conventional type but also must represent "the work" as
a single work&mdash;<i><b>The</b> [First] Book of Urizen</i>&mdash;rather
than as a collection of different visual and textual orders under one
title. In such printed editions, differences are relegated to the
editorial apparatus. In the Blake Archive, users can easily compare the
texts of different etched, drawn, or painted copies side by side. As
far as our transcriptions are concerned, however, our aim is to provide
straightforward approximations&mdash;searchable and analyzable
representations. We must recognize that they are, however accurate,
necessarily approximations, simply because <i>any</i>
transcription of Blake's irregular etched texts into the uniformities
of conventional print is at best a translation. We feel no need to
resort to elaborate typography and editorial sigla, the "barbed wire"
that Lewis Mumford and Edmund Wilson famously protested in modern
scholarly editions, because the Archive permits users to examine
transcriptions right beside superior reproductions of the originals. We
recognize that transcriptions are convenient approximations: they
cannot simulate or replace originals. </p>




      
      
      
      <p><b>Images:</b> Fidelity in the reproduction
of images is a top priority. Reproductions can never be perfect, and
our images are not intended to be "archival" in the sense sometimes
intended&mdash;virtual copies that might stand in for originals
after a
fire. But we recognize that, if we are going to contribute as we claim
to the preservation of fragile originals that are easily damaged by
handling, we must supply reproductions that scholars can depend upon in
their research. Hence our benchmarks produce images accurate enough to
be studied at a level heretofore impossible without access to the
originals. In side-by-side comparisons, images in the Archive are more
faithful to the originals in scale, color, and detail than the best
photomechanical (printed) images in all but the most extraordinary
instances. Our standard calls for high-quality born-digital images or
first-generation color transparencies in 4" x 5" format or larger, with
color bars and gray scales. Once digitized (at 600 dots per
inch [dpi] in uncompressed TIFF format in a file that serves as the
archival master for permanent storage), each raw image file is
color-corrected against the transparencies&mdash;which are
themselves
checked against the originals&mdash;by one of the editors on
professional
equipment designed and calibrated for that purpose. The main
object-view page provides reproductions at 100 dpi compressed in JPEG
format. That resolution is sufficient for most purposes and requires
graphics files of modest size that facilitate downloading and movement
from image to image. The enlargement (from the enlargement button at
the bottom of every object-view page), which on most systems takes a
few seconds longer to load for viewing, is 300 dpi (JPEG). The
enlargement yields superb detail for close inspection of printing and
coloring. Our standards of reproduction are, in short, as high as we
believe they can be under the circumstances.</p>




      
      
      
      <p>The structural priority we are granting to the physical
object is apparent in our response to the art-historical principle that
      <i>scale</i> can be a significant aspect of the
experience and meaning of an object. Thus we account archivally and
editorially for the original size of Blake's works, whether plates,
paintings, drawings, manuscripts, or printed pages. We have done that
in two ways, by displaying the actual size of every object directly
beneath it, and by providing ImageSizer, a Java applet available from
every object-view page. Retrieving the virtual object at its actual
size is tricky, given the drastic differences among computer systems.
ImageSizer allows the user to calibrate and adjust, very simply, the
size of any object&mdash;to display its actual size, or the size
that fits
the screen, or any convenient smaller or larger size.</p>




      
      
      
      <p><b>Contextual information:</b> The Archive
strives to be much more than the gateway to a vast pile of accurate
reproductions and faithful texts. This would be "access" and
"preservation" of a kind, but not a very useful kind, because access
depends largely upon information. The Archive does its best to live up
to the principle that works of art make sense only in context: the
texts in the context of the pictures and vice versa, one illuminated
book in the context of others, illuminated books in the context of
drawings and paintings, and all of Blake's works in the context of
historical information about them. Thus each object in the Archive is
embedded in several sources of information, some layered, some
overlapping, and some discrete, but all directly relevant to the
"works" that are the contents of the Archive.</p>




      
      
      
      <p><i>Copyright information:</i> Copyright may
seem editorially frivolous, but it follows directly from our emphasis
on physical objects, which raise property issues that could be largely
ignored by Blake's literary editors when dealing with a "writer" long
dead. The prominence of material objects in our schema also inevitably
means that our daily editorial reality involves us in dealings with the
owners of these objects for permissions and photography. The success of
the edition heavily depends on our ability to provide an electronic
environment where museums and collectors feel that their images are
both well displayed and safe. We return copyright of the
color-corrected digital images themselves (with file copies of those
images) back to the owner institutions (see our ).
Considering the volatile state of international electronic copyright,
controversies over fair-use policies, and owners' fears of illicit
copying, we have come to regard our copyright policy as a key part of
our editorial policy&mdash;thus all users must indicate explicit
agreement
with the conditions of use, including copyright restrictions. Moreover,
a detailed copyright notice is linked to every reproduction from the
object-view page (the link is the copyright symbol beneath the image).
Additional copyright information is linked to the Info button beneath
each image.</p>




      
      
      
      <p><i>Information about using the Archive:</i>
Detailed instructions are available to the user from all relevant pages
(from the Help button; see our Help
Documentation). To improve clarity, we have augmented verbal
instructions and explanations with graphics, such as annotated screen
images. About
the Archive offers extensive supplementary materials,
including, among much else, the Archive at a Glance and an illustrated
step-by-step Tour of major features.</p>




      
      
      
      <p><i>Bibliographical information and metadata:</i>
Each image appears along with its full bibliographical information
(production history, physical characteristics, provenance, present
location) at the level where that information becomes most relevant
(work, copy, plate, page, etc.). Thus a user looking for <i>The
Book of Thel</i> will find information about that work
(comprising all its copies, or instances) linked to the "work" page.
But all instances of the work are indeed embodied in physical
forms&mdash;"copies." Copy information&mdash;on, say, copy O of <i>The
Book of Thel</i>&mdash;is linked to every plate of that copy.
When
there is significant discrete information about the individual object,
that is provided by a link from the dimensions that appear below it.
ImageSizer is also configured to deliver (at the Info button just
beneath the image) several kinds of information about the image. In
addition to the owner, present location, contact information, and
copyright restrictions, the information includes a precise history of
the production of the reproduction itself from physical object to
electronic image via photography, scanning, and color correction. This
administrative metadata, the "image record," is embedded <i>in</i>
the image file itself and travels <i>with</i> the image
(if downloaded, for instance).</p>




      
      
      
      <p><i>Information about designs:</i> The
Archive provides information about Blake's pictures in several
complementary forms at more than one level. Although information cannot
be completely separated from interpretation, our emphasis is strongly
on information and hence on description. (If interpretations are added
to the Archive at some stage, they will be identified as such.) The
meticulous descriptions themselves may have considerable significance,
however. Many interpretations have been based on weak, partial, or
mistaken impressions of what appears in the designs. And again, users
do not have to depend ultimately upon our textual descriptions; when in
doubt, they may examine the enlargements from one or more copies. <i>General</i>
but fairly comprehensive descriptions of each image are available from
the Illustration Description link on every
object-view page&mdash;including, for example, the minute
interlinear
designs of Blake's illuminated books.</p>




      
      
      
      <p>Inote, which can be invoked from each illustration
description, will bring up the pertinent illustration in a separate
window, with access to more elaborate descriptions of individual
details within illustrations. The importance of images and their
contexts to the project registers powerfully in this Java
applet&mdash;developed at IATH and configured to the needs of the
Archive&mdash;which is available from every object-view page and
from the
illustration-information window. By means of a location-grid/overlay
metaphor, Inote makes it possible to view whole images, components
(details) of images, and descriptions of any or all of them. When the
user of Inote clicks on any sector of the image, the descriptions of
all components in that sector appear. These descriptions are, again,
specific to the image being displayed; they are not general
descriptions that average (or enumerate) the differences among plates
across various copies (instances) of a work. This level of
object-specific description has never been attempted before. Inote is
also used extensively in image searches (see below). (For technical details see our 




      
      
      
      <p><b>User-generated information:</b> The
principle that information and access are correlative is nowhere more
evident than in the user's ability to conduct comprehensive searches on
texts and images in the Archive. The power of those searches depends
upon the information (about the content of designs, for instance) that
we provide; users can employ that information in turn to gain access to
additional information and, ultimately, to create new combinations of
information relevant to their specific interests (in Blake's use of a
visual and/or textual motif, for example).</p>




      
      
      
      <p><i>Text searches:</i> From most pages in the
Archive, including all object-view pages, the user can launch searches
for any text in the Archive. The aim is to make <i>all</i>
texts in the Archive searchable. Searches produce lists of matches or
"hits" indexed by category, work, copy, and plate; choosing among
those, the user is taken to transcriptions where the search-terms are
highlighted in color. The search mechanism is, again, oriented to the
individual object. (Users who want more conventional text searches that
treat a poem as a single "work" have the option of searching the
electronic version of Erdman's print edition in the Archive.)</p>




      
      
      
      <p><i>Image Searches:</i> Similarly, the user
can launch searches for virtually any combination of details in any and
all of Blake's images. This capability&mdash;unique as far as we
know&mdash;has
been made possible by combining the resources of XML, Inote,
our search engine, and a system of image description, developed by the
editors, which employs a controlled vocabulary of <i>characteristics</i>.
(For an explanation of how we arrived at our system, see Plan
of the Archive, History, year 2, 1996-97.) These search terms
are organized for easy reference in a set of commonsense categories
(figure, including character types and names, postures, gestures, etc.;
animal; vegetation; object; and structure). The user can define a
search using up to 19 terms at once (thus, for instance, simply
"male"&mdash;a huge category&mdash;or, more limited, "bearded"
"nude" "males" who
are "crouching" in "fire" and "holding" "swords"). Like a text search,
an image search produces a list of hits; choosing among those, the user
is taken to textual descriptions of particular image details and then,
choosing among those in turn, taken (via Inote) <i>to plates
zoomed to specific image-details displayed alongside the pertinent
descriptions</i>. At the zoomed image, all the functions of Inote
are available should a user wish to explore the whole image in which
the detail appears or study any or all of the other descriptions
associated with the image.</p>




      
      
      
      <p>A final word on our editorial methodology. Although the
Blake Archive is constructed on an archival editorial rationale that we
believe is sound and fully justified, the overriding goal of the
editors is not the maintenance of theoretical purity but the creation
of a superlatively useful and durable scholarly (and pedagogical)
resource that will be available free to all who have the means of
access. Thus, although our online discussion group <i>blake-proj</i>
is full of daily debates over minute editorial issues, we had no
difficulty agreeing that we should incorporate David V. Erdman's
standard printed edition of <i>The Complete Poetry and Prose of
William Blake</i> and make its texts searchable right along with
the rest of the Archive. Though it is a fine edition in its own terms,
we are including it not because it jibes with our theories about
editing Blake but because we want the Archive to be much more than an
edition, and we want it to be as convenient as possible to its users,
who will often visit the site with Erdman's edition as their point of
departure. By similar reasoning, we have provided an extensive
bibliography of reference works, biography, and criticism that we
revise and augment at intervals; a brief biography of Blake; a glossary; and a
step-by-step account of his illuminated printing
process&mdash;a few
of what we hope will be many supplementary study aids.</p>
