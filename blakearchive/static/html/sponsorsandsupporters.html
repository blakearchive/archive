<h2><b>Current Sponsors and Supporters</b></h2>

<p>The Archive site is made possible by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the University of Rochester. Its servers are maintained by the UNC Libraries, under the direction of University Librarian and Associate Provost Sarah Michalak. The Archive also began receiving support from UNC's ITS Research Computing in the summer of 2011, as it began to redesign its publication process. Work on the Archive's full-scale redesign began in late 2013, with the Archive's team led by Co-Editor Joseph Viscomi and comprising Consultant on Special Projects (and former Project Manager) Ashley Reed, Managing Editor Joseph Fletcher, and Technical Editor Michael Fox, who as system architect designed the new front and back end, and contributed programming. Special thanks goes to Frank Yonnetti at DesignHammer for implementing the foundation of the interface. Assistant Project Manager Grant Glass joined the team in 2016. Further programming and financial support came from Mike Barker and Chris Kielt, Assistant Vice Chancellor and CIO, respectively, of Research Computing, who collaborated with a team from UNC Libraries, led by Associate University Librarian for Digital Strategies and Information Technology Timothy J. Shearer, to assist the Archive in realizing the new design. The Archive is especially grateful for the work of Nathan Rice, from Research Computing, and Luke Aeschleman, from the Libraries, whose programming and web-design assistance were vital to the completion of the redesign.</p> 

<p>The Library of Congress, our original sponsor, continues to support the Archive, along with an international array of libraries and museums (see Contributing Collections) that have generously given the Archive permission to reproduce works from their collections.</p>

<h2><b>Past Sponsors and Supporters</b></h2>

<p>The William Blake Archive was launched in 1995, with support from the Getty Grant Program and under the auspices of the Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities (IATH) at the University of Virginia. The following statement from May 2000, about the Archive's relationship with IATH was written by John Unsworth, its director at the time:</p>

<blockquote><p>From the Institute's point of view, the William Blake Archive is a highly successful example of networked collaboration in a scholarly research project. This project involves daily communication and cooperation among researchers, programmers, and assistants in four different locations, with only one face-to-face meeting a year. In spite of its geographical dispersion, this project group has worked extremely effectively, over the last several years: evidence of this effectiveness is in the Archive itself, which is a body of work done to the very highest editorial, aesthetic, and technical standards throughout.</p>

<p>In many respects, electronic scholarship in the humanities is still in its infancy: therefore, it is all the more important that we have examples to show that it can be successful--not only in innovating, but also, perhaps more importantly at this stage, in measuring up to traditional scholarly standards. The Blake Archive has done both, and in so doing has shown, definitively, that electronic scholarship is not an oxymoron.</p>

<p>Since the mission of the Institute is to support the research of scholars in the humanities, its technical innovations are driven by the research goals of its Fellows. The Blake project brings the resources of advanced computing to bear on complex problems in art history, including reproduction, cataloguing, and conservation. One of the most important challenges that the project has presented to the Institute has been the need to produce digital reproductions that satisfy researchers for whom color fidelity and image resolution are essential, while still accommodating the file-size restrictions of the Web. Eaves, Essick, and Viscomi have also been the first production users of the Institute's Inote software, a Java application for image annotation which is now a key element in the Blake Archive.</p></blockquote>

<p>In 2006, the Blake Archive moved to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and joined the Carolina Digital Library and Archives in 2007, with additional support coming from the English and Comparative Literature Department at UNC, as well as the Department of English at the University of Rochester. In February of 2008, CDLA’s then-director, Kirill Fesenko, issued the following statement:</p>

<blockquote><p>The Carolina Digital Library and Archives welcomes the William Blake Archive to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Known throughout the academy for its scholarly rigor and high image presentation standards, the William Blake Archive has become one of the most respected and emulated digital humanities projects. CDLA is proud to provide support and assistance to its editors and staff.</p>

<p>In moving its base of operations to UNC under the auspices of CDLA and the University Library, the Blake Archive joins Documenting the American South, the Russia Beyond Russia Digital Archive, the Thomas Wolfe Collection, the Folkstreams Film Archive and many other wide-ranging collections that combine the power and resources of digital presentation with the highest standards of scholarship in order to make important archival materials available to the international academic community.</p></blockquote>

<p>In November 2013, services that were part of the Carolina Digital Library and Archives were fully integrated into ongoing UNC Library operations. Addressing this transition, the Library issued a statement affirming that it “remains committed to the preservation of digital projects developed through faculty partnerships, and to continued collaborative innovation around digital initiatives.”</p>

<p>In addition to the Getty Grant Program, which provided major funding for the first phase of design and construction [see Plan of the Archive], our past sponsors include the Preservation and Access Division of the National Endowment for the Humanities, which helped to fund the second phase, and the Scholarly Editions and Translations Division of the National Endowment for the Humanities, which helped to fund the fourth phase; the Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art, London; Sun Microsystems and Inso Corporation, which made software and hardware contributions.</p>
