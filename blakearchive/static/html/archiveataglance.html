      Over the course of two centuries, respect for the prints, paintings, and poems of William Blake (1757-1827) has increased to a degree that would have astonished his contemporaries. Today both his poetry and visual art in several media are admired by a global audience. In the broadest terms, the William Blake Archive is a contemporary response to the needs of this dispersed and various audience of readers and viewers and to the corresponding needs of the collections where Blake's original works are currently held.

      <p>
A free site since 1996, the Blake Archive was conceived as an international public resource that would provide unified access to major works of visual and literary art that are highly disparate, widely dispersed, and more and more often severely restricted as a result of their value, rarity, and extreme fragility. A growing number of contributors have given the Archive permission to include thousands of Blake's images and texts without fees.

Through intensive collaboration, initially between the editors and the Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities and now among the editors and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Libraries and Research Computing, the Archive has been able to achieve exceptionally high standards of site construction, digital representation, and electronic editing that are, we believe, models of their kind. Advanced principles of design allow the Blake Archive to integrate editions, catalogues, databases, and scholarly tools into one electronic archival resource. We supply reproductions that are more accurate in color, detail, and scale than the finest commercially published photomechanical reproductions, and texts that are more faithful to Blake's own than any collected edition has provided.

      <p>
To accomplish this with equally high standards, we publish critical editions of works as well what we call Works in Preview. For the critical editions, we supply a wealth of contextual information, which includes full and accurate bibliographical details and meticulous descriptions of the content of each image. Users may view the editions in either Gallery Mode or Reading Mode, each mode catering to different needs of the scholar or teacher in the classroom. The Works in Preview wing presents designs that are among Blake’s largest and most complex. Instead of waiting until the details of the designs are fully encoded—which makes them more fully searchable but can take years to complete—the Archive presents the designs in the format of high-resolution zoomable images, enabling viewers to enlarge them many times their true size to reveal details not previously visible in any reproductions.

The Archive also provides robust search functionality, enhanced by the editors' controlled vocabulary and detailed image descriptions, as well as a virtual lightbox and an Application Programming Interface—all to facilitate various approaches to the scholarly study of Blake’s materials. Finally, users of the Archive can enjoy learning more about Blake in its digital exhibition wing, which hosts curated exhibitions of selected works or special topics dealing with Blake's oeuvre.
