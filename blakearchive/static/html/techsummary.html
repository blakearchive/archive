      <p>The electronic files containing the texts, images, and supporting apparatus for the William Blake Archive are distributed across three separate servers: the public site server (www.blakearchive.org), an internal testing site server, and the file server containing our archives, records, and work in progress. All three servers run versions of the Linux operating system. The servers were initially hosted by the Institute for Advanced Technologies in the Humanities (IATH) at the University of Virginia. In 2006-2007, the Archive migrated to servers hosted and maintained by the Library Systems department at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.</p>




        
      
      <h3 class="c3">Imaging</h3>




        
      
      <p><b>Scanning:</b> We scan digital images from three types of source media: 4" x 5" transparencies, 8" x 10" transparencies, and 35mm slides. The transparencies, which include color bars and gray scales to ensure color fidelity, are verified for color accuracy against the original artifact by the photographer and often by an editor as well.</p>



        
      
      <p>We scan transparencies on a flatbed scanner. Initially, we used a Microtek Scanmaker III with a transparent media adapter. We upgraded to a Microtek Scanmaker V in May 1998. This model offered two advances: a separate drawer to hold 4" x 5" film inside the body of the scanner and Microtek's EDIT (Emulsion Direct Imaging Technology) system. From 2002 until early 2005, we scanned transparencies on a Microtek ArtixScan 1100, an advanced version of the Scanmaker V. In 2005, we replaced the ArtixScan 1100 with a Microtek Scanmaker i900.</p>



        
      
      <p>Slides are used only occasionally in the Archive; we scan them using the 35mm slide tray of the Scanmaker i900; in the past we used a Nikon LS-3510AF Slide Scanner and a Microtek 35t Plus Scanner.</p>



        
      
      <p>We use the most recent version of Microtek's ScanWizard software (as of this writing, 7.6). The i900 is attached to a dual 2GHz Power Macintosh G5 running Mac OS X.</p>



        
      
            <p>We began with a baseline standard of 24-bit color and 300 dpi (dots per inch) resolution for all scanned images. Due to hardware improvements—more internal storage, more RAM, writeable CDs and DVDs, and better scanners—we are now scanning at 600 dpi. The 600 dpi "raw scans" are stored on DVD as LZW-compressed TIFFs, from which we derive 300 dpi TIFF images for color correction. Most images are scaled 1:1 against the source dimensions of the original artifact, but images larger than 40 x 30 cm are scaled 1:2/3 to reduce the file sizes of image enlargements. 
            </p>
            <p>On a monitor with 100 dpi screen resolution most images display in the Object View Page at true size and their enlargements display at three times the size of the original. There are a few exceptions. Objects larger than 40 x 30 cm are displayed smaller than true size on Object View Pages to make them viewable in their entirety without the need for scrolling. These objects can be viewed at true size using the ImageSizer applet (see below).</p>



        
      
      <p>As part of the scanning process for each image, a project assistant completes a form known as an Image Production (IP) record. The IP records contain detailed technical data about the creation of the digital file for each image. These records are retained in hard copy at the project office, and they become part of the Image Information record that is inserted into each image as metadata (see below).</p>



        
      
      <p>To ensure color consistency, we calibrate our scanners and computer monitors on a regular basis; to ensure image clarity, we use compressed air to blow dust, lint, and hair from the scanner bed and the transparency before each scan.</p>




        
      
      <p><b>Color Correction:</b> Using Adobe Photoshop, an editor color-corrects the raw scanned images against the original transparency or slide, which has itself been color-corrected against the original artifact. Between 1996 and 2001, we used Adobe Photoshop 4.0 and 5.0 in conjunction with hooded Radius PressView 17SR and 21SR monitors, calibrated using ProSense 1.8 software. Between 2002 and 2004, we used LaCie Electron 19 Blue and Electron 22 Blue monitors calibrated with the LaCie Blue Eye Sensor and software. Between 2004 and 2007, we used Adobe Photoshop CS with Apple 20" Cinema and 23" Cinema HD Displays. As of this writing, we use Adobe Photoshop CS3 and Apple 30" Cinema HD Displays. Since 2004, all displays have been calibrated with a GretagMacbeth Eye-One calibrator. </p>


        
      
      <p>The color correction process is necessary in order to bring the color channels of the digital image into alignment with the hues and color tones of the original. The process can take up to several hours per image, though it ordinarily takes around thirty minutes. This step is key in establishing the scholarly integrity of the Archive, for it ensures that each image will match the original artifact when displayed under optimal conditions. Although we cannot control the color settings of an individual user's monitor, we specify these optimal viewing conditions, allowing users to adjust their monitor settings appropriately.</p>



        
      
      <p><b>File Formats and Archival Storage:</b> All scanned images are saved using the Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) and archived as such on removable storage media. The Archive began on 8mm magnetic Exabyte tape and is now maintained on CD-ROM (in ISO 9660 hybrid format) and DVD. In addition, TIFF images are backed up to networked "dark archive" storage provided by Carolina Digital Library and Archives. These archived raw images would provide the source for newly color-corrected images if necessary.</p>



      
      <p>The color-corrected images displayed to users in the online Archive are presented in the JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group, ISO/IEC 10918) format. Users are presented with an inline image in the Object View Page at 100 dpi and have the option to view an enlargement at 300 dpi for the study of details. The 100 dpi JPEG is derived from the color-corrected 300 dpi JPEG using ImageMagick, a UNIX software package that enables the batch processing of image files from the command line.</p>




        
      
      <p><b>Metadata:</b> Each and every image in the Archive also contains textual metadata comprising its Image Information record. The Image Information record combines the technical data recorded in the Image Production record (see above) with additional bibliographic documentation of the image, as well as information pertaining to provenance, present location, and the owning institution.</p>



      
      <p>These textual records are, at the most literal level, a part of the Archive's image files. Image files are typically considered to be nothing but information about the images themselves, but in practice, an image file can be the container for several different kinds of information. The William Blake Archive takes advantage of this capability by inserting its Image Information records into the portion of the image file reserved for textual metadata. This integration allows the record to travel with the image, even if the image is downloaded and detached from the Archive.</p>



      
      <p>The Image Information record may be viewed using the "Info" button located on the control panel of the Archive's ImageSizer applet (see below) or with the Text Display feature of standard software such as Adobe Photoshop or X-View.</p>



        
      
      <h3 class="c3">eXtensible Markup Language (XML)</h3>




        
      
      <p>All significant textual data in the Archive—Blake's actual poetry and prose, as well as the editors' bibliographic commentary and illustration descriptions—is encoded using eXtensible Markup Language (XML). XML is not a programming language; it is a descriptive meta-language used to encode (or "tag") textual data in such a way that it will remain usable even as platforms and file formats change over time. To take a very simple example, whereas the word processor used to write this document would represent italics by means of a proprietary binary code, XML would indicate italics with a plain ASCII tag such as: <hi rend="italic">this<hi>. But XML does not have to be merely descriptive; unlike HTML, XML allows us to identify and encode the structure of documents. A title or heading (to once again take a very simple example) can be tagged and described as such rather than being simply rendered in a large font or in boldface, etc., as HTML would encourage. By explicitly describing textual data according to a recognized W3C standard, XML frees the Archive from reliance on the vicissitudes of proprietary software packages.</p>



      
      <p>A set of XML tags designed for a specific purpose is known as a Document Type Definition (DTD). A DTD provides a hierarchical system of contexts and constraints which enables its tags to be used to create consistent document structures. The Blake Archive makes use of several DTDs developed specifically for the project when it was hosted at IATH. The primary and most expansive of these is known as the Blake Archive Description (BAD). The BAD DTD is used to encode all works at both the object and the collection level; its emphasis is on the description of Blake's works as physical artifacts. The BAD provides the basic document structure used to deliver the Archive's content to users and also serves as the information-base consulted by the Archive's search engines (see below). The Archive's second DTD, the Blake Object Description (BOD) is used to encode the textual metadata that constitutes the image information record.</p>



      
      <p>The Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) DTD is used for other materials in the archive, such as its bibliographies, collection lists and Erdman's Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake, where description of the physical artifact is not the DTD's central purpose.</p>



      
      <p><b>The Archive on the Web</b>: Delivery of the William Blake Archive on the Web is supported by three key components. All technologies are open source and standards based. First, the XML-encoded documents are stored in and indexed as an eXist database. Second, an assortment of custom XSL transforms produce HTML from our XML. Third, Apache Cocoon plays traffic cop, receiving and dispatching requests between users and applications. Each of these technologies is described at greater length below.</p>

      
      <ul>


 <li><b>Apache Cocoon</b> is a Web development framework that facilitates
    communication between and coordinates responses among the independent
    components that provide the various functions offered by the Archive.
    It might be understood as the "glue" that binds the Apache server
    software, the eXist database of XML documents, and the XSL
    transforms. More information about Apache Cocoon is available <a href="http://cocoon.apache.org">here</a>.
 </li>

        <li><b>eXist</b> is an open source native XML database used by the Archive to
store, index, and search our XML-encoded documents. eXist utilizes
    xQuery for searching and offers both index-based and full-text
    searching. More information about eXist is available <a href="//exist.sourceforge.net/index.html">here</a>.
 </li>

        <li><b>eXtensible Stylesheet Language</b> (XSL) facilitates the transformation
    of our XML documents into HTML for display on the Web. Since XML
    describes the structure and semantics of a document rather than
    specifying preferences for its display, an XSL transform must be
    written to translate the XML into HTML. Also called stylesheets, XSL
    transforms can turn XML into many data formats, including ASCII text,
    HTML, and PDF. The William Blake Archive relies on a variety of XSL
    stylesheets to transform our XML-encoded documents into the HTML web
    pages accessed by our users. This translation happens "on the fly,"
    meaning that there is no need for us to create and maintain separate
    HTML files to mirror the Archive's XML-encoded materials. Rather, our
    XML is rendered as HTML by the XSL stylesheets whenever it is
    accessed by a user with a Web browser.
        </li>

      
      </ul>


      
      <p></p>



        
      
      <h3 class="c3">Java</h3>




        
      
      <p><a href="http://www.javasoft.com">Java</a> is a platform-independent programming language developed by Sun
Microsystems in order to facilitate object-oriented programming in
conjunction with the HTTP layer of the World Wide Web. 
Software written in Java can be "run" (activated) directly from ordinary
Web pages, without requiring users to have pre-installed any of the
software's files on their own personal machine and without regard for the
type of computer or operating system used to access the Web page 
from which the Java software is invoked. The Blake Archive uses two separate Java applets (or
applications).  Both were developed at IATH, and continue to be maintained at CDLA, in order to support the image-based
editing that is fundamental to the project. Both of these applets, Inote
and the ImageSizer, should be understood as computational implementations
of the editorial practices governing the design of the Archive and its
scholarly objectives. Both applets are based on version 1.3 of the Java
Development Kit (JDK).</p>




        
      
      <p><b>Inote:</b> Inote is an image-annotation tool. It permits us to append textual
notes ("annotations") to selected regions (or "details") of a particular
image; these annotations are generated directly from the XML-encoded
illustration descriptions prepared by the editors. Inote functions most
powerfully when used in conjunction with the Archive's image searching
capabilities, where it can open an image found by the search engine,
zoomed to the quadrant of the image containing the object(s) of the
search query, with the relevant textual annotation displayed in a
separate window. From there,
Inote allows the user to enlarge the image for further study and/or to
access additional annotations located in other regions of the image.
Inote may also be invoked directly from any of the Archive's Object View
Pages, allowing users to "browse" the annotations created for a given
image.</p>



      
      <p>In addition, users can download and install their own executable copies
of Inote on their personal computers (using a version of the software
programmed in the Java Runtime Environment); upon doing so, they may
attach annotations of their own making to locally saved copies of an
image, for use in either teaching or research. The most recent release of
Inote is version 6.0.</p>




        
      
      <p><b>ImageSizer:</b> The ImageSizer is a sophisticated image
        manipulation tool. Its principal function for the
Archive is to allow users to view Blake's work on their computer screens
at its actual physical dimensions. Users may invoke the ImageSizer's
calibration applet to set a "cookie" informing the ImageSizer of their
own unique screen-resolution. Based on this data (recorded in the
cookie), all subsequently viewed images will be resized on the fly so as
to appear at their true size on the user's screen. If a user returns to
the Archive at some later date from the same machine, the data stored by
the cookie will remain intact, and there will be no need to recalibrate.
Users may also set the ImageSizer's calibration applet to deliver images
sized at consistent proportions other than true size, for example, at
twice normal size (for the study of details). In addition, the ImageSizer
allows users to enlarge or reduce the image within its on-screen display
area, and to view the textual metadata comprising the Image Information
record embedded in each digital image file (see above).</p>




        
      
      <h3 class="c3">Other</h3>




        
      
      <p><b>Work in Progress Site:</b> The Archive maintains a password-protected Work in Progress (WIP) site for the exclusive use of the editors and the project staff. The WIP site provides gateways to private testing ports on our servers, which allow us to proof works in the Archive's online environment without their being publicly accessible to users before they've reached their finished state. The WIP site also houses a variety of tracking sheets, enabling the editors and project staff to accurately monitor the different stages of preparation for the many hundreds of text and image files in the Archive, as well as a Reference area for other materials (such as a file of unsolved problems, agendas for project meetings, copies of grant and development materials, a complete archive of postings from the blake-proj list, etc.—see below).</p>




        
      
      <p><b>E-mail:</b> The Blake Archive currently operates three electronic mailing lists. The oldest of these, an internal communications list known as blake-proj, has existed since the project's inception and serves as the focal point for discussions among the editors, the project staff, and the technical staff at CDLA. All traffic on blake-proj is archived and available to the project editors and staff. A second internal list, blake-board, was created in fall of 1998 to facilitate communication between the editors and the Archive's Advisory Board. Finally, a public list, also created in 1998 and known as blake-update, is used for distribution of periodic updates and announcements to our users. Any visitor to the Archive may subscribe to blake-update via a form on our front-end web pages. All lists are maintained by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill using the Lyris Listmanager software.</p>




        
      
      <p><b>Access Tracking:</b> Access to the Archive's servers is tracked by the Apache web server. The log files provide daily records that allow us to observe the frequency with which texts and images are requested by users, as well as the type of browser and platform being used to access the Archive, the IP address of the users, and their domain name (allowing us to compare, say, access from educational sites with access from commercial sites).</p>




        
      
      <p><b>Backup and Record Keeping</b>: All of the Archive's data is safeguarded via daily, incremental backups. Weekly backups are stored off-site. In the event of a catastrophic disk failure or a server break-in, the Archive's data could be quickly restored from the backup system.</p>



      
      <p>The Archive's project office retains hard copies of all image production records, as well as ledgers tracking electronic file transfers, consignment of TIFF images to CD-ROM, and shipping of transparencies and slides.</p>

      <h3 class="c3">Imaging</h3>

<p><b>Scanning:</b> When the Archive migrated to University of North Carolina servers in late 2006-2007, we stopped scanning transparencies. Now all images we acquire of Blake’s original works are born digital. They are usually photographed according to our protocols outlined above (300 dpi TIFFs scaled 1:1 to the original image) and are more accurate, particularly for paper tone and texture, than transparencies. Occasionally these digital images come in at higher resolutions and 48-bit color instead of 24-bit color. We adjust these larger files/images in Adobe Photoshop to fit our imaging protocols. The born digital images come with grey scales and color bars to assist in color correction and, like the other digital images in the Archive, are given Generic RBG Profiles.</p>

<p>Before June 2012 most images were scaled 1:1 against the source dimensions of the original artifact, but images larger than 40 x 30 cm were scaled 1:2/3 to reduce the file sizes of image enlargements. As of June 2012 all images are scaled 1:1 (to reflect increased digital storage capacity, higher bandwidth availability, and faster download speeds). Images scaled 1:2/3 have image enlargements that are two times larger than true size; images scaled 1:1 have enlargements that are three times larger than true size. Since images scanned at 1:2/3 cannot be retroactively enlarged without losing image quality, there is some scaling inconsistency among the enlargements available in the Archive. Each object view page lists the size of the physical object at the lower right-hand corner of the ImageSizer window. Users are advised to consult these measurements when in doubt about the true size of an object.</p>

<p>Raw TIFF images are now backed up to a dedicated server provided and maintained by the Archive instead of to DVDs or the Carolina Digital Library and Archive.</p>

<p><b>Color Correcting:</b> Since 2007, we continue to use the most current version of Adobe Photoshop with Apple 23” and 30" Cinema HD displays connected to a Mac Pro and a 27 inch iMac. All displays have been calibrated with a GretagMacbeth Eye-One calibrator.</p>

<h3 class="c3">System Architecture and Basic Front-End Navigation</h3> 

<p>The new Blake Archive site does not use some of the technologies that the old site did, such as Java and ImageSizer, and the entire architecture of the old site's web application has been replaced. The new application is divided into four parts: the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.blakearchive.org">site proper</a>, meaning our archive of Blake's works; a collection of back issues from <a target="_blank" href="http://bq.blakearchive.org"><i>Blake: An Illustrated Quarterly</i></a>; <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.blakearchive.org">our blog</a>; and <a target="_blank" href="http://erdman.blakearchive.org"><i>The Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake</i></a> edited by David Erdman.</p>

<p>The site proper is made up of three components: images, data, and application code. Images are processed as they have been since 2007 (see above). The data come in two forms, CSV files and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3.org/XML/">XML</a> files. Our CSV files encode such data as: relationships between objects; types of those relationships; work information; virtual groupings of works; homepage images and links; and more. We have two types of XML documents. The first we call a work info file. It lists 'All Known Related Works' for a particular work, which include works or objects not currently in the Archive. The second type of XML document we use is what we call a Blake Archive Document, or BAD, which contains the entire critical apparatus for a particular copy of a work and all of its objects.</p>

<p>These data meet the application code at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> scripts, which convert some of them into <a target="_blank" href="http://www.json.org/">JSON</a> for further processing, import them into a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> database, and index them in a <a target="_blank" href="https://lucene.apache.org/solr/">Solr</a> instance. The database has three tables: BlakeWork, BlakeCopy, and BlakeObject. They overlap somewhat. For example, a BlakeWork and a BlakeCopy both contain the composition date of the associated work. They are constructed this way to allow for the most efficient access from the modular architecture of the <a target="_blank" href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> that governs the site.</p>

<p>This part of the application code begins in main.html, which imports all the necessary <a target="_blank" href="https://www.javascript.com/">Javascript</a> libraries and CSS stylesheets. It also establishes a number of stable parts of the site: the persistent banner, from which a user may return to the homepage, select a work, change viewing modes, or search the Archive; a persistent footer, from which a user may get to the site's static pages; and a viewport, through which our AngularJS application is routed. The AngularJS application is divided into a few minor controllers and five main ones. The main ones are: a Home controller, a Work, Copy, Static Page, and Search controller. At a high level, they are practically self-explanatory. The Home controller operates the homepage, which gives access to a random set of objects in the Archive. The Work controller operates the work info page for each of Blake's works. The Copy controller operates the object view page for each copy, the compare view for objects being compared, and the reading view. The Static Page controller operates the static pages accessible via the persistent footer. And the Search controller operates the search feature in the banner and the search results page.</p>

<p>In our Solr schema, the data is broken down in a way similar to the way it is in the database. Our Solr index has three types of documents: a blake_work, a blake_copy, and a blake_object document. This structure allows searching within a work within a copy within an object. See the search results page for a visualization. A user may select a resulting object from a particular copy of a single work, and may filter a search by date, type, or medium.</p>

<p>On the site proper, a user may switch between two modes, Gallery Mode and Reading Mode, each providing a different viewing experience. In the default Gallery Mode, copies of works are displayed in a gallery format on the object view page. In the object view, a suite of tools is provided for each image: Rotate, Zoom, True Size, Enlargement, Transcription, Generate Citation, and if applicable, Supplemental Views. They are self-explanatory. Part of the critical apparatus for the copy is provided in the info box accessible via the 'i' button on the gallery window. Here, a user may see the textual transcription, illustration description, and editors' notes for the object being viewed. The rest of the critical apparatus is provided at the bottom half of the object view page under some subset of the following tabs, depending on which ones are applicable to the object being viewed: Objects in Copy/Group, Objects from the Same Matrix, Objects from the Same Production Sequence, Objects with a Similar Design, Textually Referenced Objects, Copy/Work/Letter Information, and Electronic Edition Information.</p>

<p>Under tabs having to do with relationships, a user may select objects for comparison in the compare view, which is essentially the same as the object view except that in the compare view the gallery contains a side-by-side comparison of the selected related objects. In the compare view, the information under the critical apparatus tabs is always tied to the highlighted object in the gallery window.</p>

<p>In Reading Mode, copies of works are displayed in a reading view, that is, a horizontally scrollable window containing the objects of the copy in sequence with their accompanying transcriptions and without any supporting critical apparatus.</p>

<p>The banner of the site changes, depending on where a user is stationed and what mode the user is in. If the user is viewing a static page, the banner will display the title of the page in a little black strip. In Reading Mode, the black strip will show the title of the work being viewed and the copy designation if applicable. In Gallery Mode, the black strip will do the same if in the object view, or will indicate 'Selected' if in the compare view. The work title in both modes is always linked to an overlay window containing an index of all the copies of that work. This overlay is equivalent to the work info page for the work, but being accessible beyond the work info page, the overlay allows the user to more efficiently navigate between copies.</p>

<p>The front end of the site is styled with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html">CSS</a>. Some of the site's marked-up text, such as the transcriptions, is rendered with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xslt">XSLT</a>. And the code for the entire site is written on top of <a target="_blank" href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>, the Javascript framework for responsive design, so the Archive may be enjoyed in miniature on mobile devices.</p>

<p>The other parts of the Archive--to repeat--are: a collection of back issues from <a target="_blank" href="http://bq.blakearchive.org"><i>Blake: An Illustrated Quarterly</i></a>, our <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.blakearchive.org">blog</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="http://erdman.blakearchive.org"><i>The Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake</i></a> edited by David Erdman. The journal archive is written in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a> and indexed in its own Solr core. The blog is done in <a target="_blank" href="https://wordpress.com/">Wordpress</a>, and the digital Erdman edition, architected similarly to the site proper, is encoded in XML, which is indexed in its own Solr core and transformed with XSLT. And the application for the edition is written in AngularJS and styled with CSS.</p>

<p>We also make available an API for those users who wish to mine our data.</p>

<p>In the near future, the Archive will add two substantive parts to the web application: an exhibition space, where peer-reviewed exhibitions will be published; and a Lightbox application, where users may manipulate or curate Archive images for more refined study.</p>

<p>The open-source repositories of our github organization, blakearchive, are available <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/blakearchive/">here</a>.
