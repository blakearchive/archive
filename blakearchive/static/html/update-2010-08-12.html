      <!--<h2 class="title">What's New in the William Blake Archive</h2>-->
      12 August 2010
      <p/>
      The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of electronic editions of <a href="https://www.blakearchive.org/work/mhh"><i>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</i></a> copies <a href="https://www.blakearchive.org/copy/mhh.b">B</a> and <a href="https://www.blakearchive.org/copy/mhh.e">E</a>, in the Bodleian Library, Oxford University, and Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, England, respectively. The Archive is also publishing the Blake collection list for the Bodleian Library, accessible under Resources for Further Research.
      <p>
        Only nine complete copies of the <i>Marriage</i> are known to exist; copies B and E&#8212;here reproduced for the first time in their entirety and in color&#8212;join copies C, D, F, G, H, and I, previously published in the Archive.
        <p>
          Blake etched twenty-seven plates for the <i>Marriage</i> in relief in 1790.  Copy B, one of the first complete copies printed, is essentially monochrome, relying on colored inks rather than water color washes for its coloring. It was produced with copy H in 1790, with plates printed in various shades of reddish brown, yellow ochre, raw umber, olive green, and green on both sides of the leaves. However, the impressions forming copy H (Fitzwilliam Museum) were extensively finished in watercolors and pen and ink, with texts gone over in various colored inks, letter by letter, line by line, presumably when sold in 1821 to Blake's young patron, John Linnell. Copy B, its sister copy, looks nothing like copy H, but provides an excellent idea of what copy H originally looked like.
          <p>
            Copy E is also a sister copy, beautifully and heavily color printed c. 1794 on one side of the leaf with copy F (Morgan Library). It was produced in the style used for <i>Songs of Experience</i> of <i>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</i> copy F and <i>Visions of the Daughters of Albion</i> copy F, both color printed c. 1794 and in the Archive. The plates in copy E were once ordered other than 1-27, as they are now, but this variant plate order is probably not by Blake. The red outlines around eleven images are not by Blake. 
            <p>
              Like all the illuminated books in the Archive, the texts and images of <i>Marriage</i> copies B and E are fully searchable and are supported by our Inote and ImageSizer applications. With the Archive's Compare feature, users can easily juxtapose multiple impressions of any plate across the different copies of this or any of the other illuminated books.
              <p>
                With the publication of <i>Marriage</i> copies B and E, the Archive now contains fully searchable and scalable electronic editions of 77 copies of Blake's nineteen illuminated works in the context of full bibliographic information about each work, careful diplomatic transcriptions of all texts, detailed descriptions of all images, and extensive bibliographies. In addition to illuminated books, the Archive contains many important manuscripts and series of engravings, sketches, and water color drawings, including  <a href="https://www.blakearchive.org/work/but335">illustrations to Thomas Gray's <i>Poems</i></a>, <a href="https://www.blakearchive.org/work/but812">water color</a> and <a href="https://www.blakearchive.org/work/bb448">engraved</a> illustrations to Dante's <i>Divine Comedy</i>, the <a href="https://www.blakearchive.org/work/cpd">large color printed drawings of 1795 and c. 1805</a>, the <a href="https://www.blakearchive.org/work/but551">Linnell</a> and <a href="https://www.blakearchive.org/work/but550">Butts</a> sets of the <i>Book of Job</i> water colors and the <a href="https://www.blakearchive.org/work/but557">sketchbook</a> containing drawings for the <a href="https://www.blakearchive.org/work/bb421">engraved</a> illustrations to the <i>Book of Job</i>, the water color <a href="https://www.blakearchive.org/work/bb435">illustrations to Robert Blair's <i>The Grave</i></a>, and all nine of Blake's water color series illustrating the poetry of John Milton.

                  As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access restrictions and charging no subscription fees.
