Significance</b> </h2>

      <p>Over the course of two
centuries, respect for the poems,
prints, and paintings of William Blake (1757-1827) has increased to a
degree that would have astonished his contemporaries. Now, more than a
century since the "Blake revival" was inaugurated by a cadre of
Victorian writers and artists, he is universally regarded as a seminal
literary and visual artist. Today both his poetry and visual art in
several media are admired by a global audience. He is one of the most
anthologized and studied writers in English, and "The Tyger" is the
most anthologized poem in the language. Blake's poetry and prose have
been translated into many languages, and the published scholarship is
international. According to G. E. Bentley, Jr., there is Blake
criticism in Bulgarian, Catalan, Chinese (Mandarin and Cantonese),
Czech, Danish, Dutch, Esperanto, Finnish, French, German, Greek,
Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Latin, Latvian,
Lithuanian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian,
Serbo-Croatian, Spanish, Swedish, and Welsh. <i>Blake Studies in
Japan</i>
(Bentley and Aoyama, 1994) alone contains nearly 1000 entries.</p>

      <p>Likewise, Blake is one of
the most exhibited and collected of British
visual artists: in April 1999, one copy of his illuminated <i>[First]
Book
of Urizen</i> (24 plates) sold at auction for $2.5 million,
widely noted at
the time to have been the most ever paid for a work of British
"literature," and in 2004 a color printed drawing, "The Good
and Evil Angels," sold at auction for $3.9
million&#8212;perhaps a record price for <i>any</i>
print by anyone. In
2006 some of his newly discovered watercolors for Robert Blair's <i>The
Grave</i> fetched high prices at auction. In recent years large
shows have
been mounted in Australia, England, France, Germany, Israel, Japan,
Scotland, Spain, and the United States, including major exhibitions in
Melbourne (1989), Tokyo (1990), Barcelona (1996), Madrid (1996),
Melbourne (1999), Paris (2009), and New York (2009-10). Tate Britain's
enormous 2000-01 exhibition moved to the Metropolitan Museum of New
York in 2001, and the Huntington Library and Art Gallery mounted an
exhibition in 2003. More major international conferences,
exhibitions, and other special events marked the 250th anniversary of
Blake's birth in 2007.</p>

      <p>Blake&#8212;in
various configurations of his life,
words, and
images&#8212;has established and maintained a kind of multifaceted
cultural currency that is exceedingly rare. His images are icons,
endlessly reproduced wherever striking images are needed, and every
year his words are incorporated into
books on science, technology,
history, religion, and art. Jacob Epstein sculpted a bust of Blake;
Francis Bacon painted his portrait. Blake's color print "Newton,"
translated into a twelve-foot statue by Eduardo Paolozzi, greets all
visitors to the new British Library. Notable composers, including
Benjamin Britten, Ralph Vaughan Williams, Paul Hindemith, Gustav Holst,
Virgil Thomson, and William Bolcom, have set his words to music
hundreds if not thousands of times&#8212;more often than any
British writer other than Shakespeare. There are significant Blake
ballets (Ralph Vaughan Williams), Blake operas (Britten's <i>The Little Sweep</i>), and Blake
movies (Jim Jarmusch's <i>Dead Man</i>). Since it was set
to
music in 1902 by Hubert Parry, the prefatory poem to Blake's
illuminated book <i>Milton</i>&#8212;"And did those
feet in ancient
time"&#8212;has evolved into an alternative national anthem for the
British. On the popular music scene Blake's influence has been profound
for half a century; his words have been extensively recorded by major
artists.</p>

      <p>Blake's resonance now
extends to the students of the wide range of
biblical and literary texts that he illustrated. Recent
interdisciplinary approaches in literary studies, art history, and
religious studies, especially, have encouraged students to understand
illustrations as visual commentaries. Blake's
illustrations&#8212;those of the Book of Job and many other scenes
from the Old and New Testaments; Dante's <i>Divine Comedy</i>;
Virgil's
      <i>Eclogues</i>; Chaucer's <i>Canterbury Tales</i>;
Spenser's <i>Fairie Queene</i>;
Shakespeare's plays; Milton's <i>Paradise Lost</i>,
"Nativity Ode," <i>Comus</i>,
      <i>Paradise Regained</i>, "L'Allegro," and "Il
Penseroso"; Thomas Gray's poems;
and the powerful illustrations to John Stedman's <i>Narrative,
of a Five
Years' Expedition, against the Revolted Negroes of Surinam</i>,
for
example&#8212;offer such critical opportunities.</p>

      <p>In the broadest terms,
the William Blake Archive, an archive of
scholarly electronic editions freely available on the World Wide Web,
is a contemporary response to the needs of this dispersed and various
audience and to the reciprocal needs of the collections that currently
hold Blake's original works. Both the audience and the collections on
which the audience must rely share a strong interest in the
accessibility and preservation of Blake's works. The Blake Archive
attempts to serve both sets of needs at once by providing free access
to its Web site, where Blake's works are accessible to a degree
heretofore impossible. Whether our users' inquiries are inspired by a
love of imaginative art and writing, term papers, or scholarly
research, no other resource can match the depth or range of access
provided by the archiving, searching, and viewing options at our Web
site.</p>

      <p>But we have designed the
site primarily with scholars in mind. For them
we believe that the Archive has become indispensable&#8212;as a
handy reference, a point of departure, or a site of sustained research.
The Archive has adhered to exceptionally high standards of site
construction, digital reproduction, and electronic editing that are, we
believe, models of their kind. They make it possible for the Archive to
deliver <i>reproductions</i> that are more accurate in
color, detail, and
scale than the finest commercially published photomechanical
reproductions and texts that are more faithful to Blake's own than any
collected edition has provided. We have applied equally high standards
in supplying a wealth of contextual information, which includes full
and accurate bibliographical details and meticulous descriptions of the
content of each image. Finally, users of the Archive can attain a new
degree of access to these works through the combination of powerful
text-searching and (for the first time in any medium) advanced
image-searching tools that are made possible by the editors' XML markup
systems, detailed image descriptions, and innovative text and image
software. Although we have designed the Archive to function properly
within the limits of existing systems, we have built in considerable
allowance for future improvements in hardware and software.</p>

      <p>The Blake Archive first
opened to the public in 1996 with simple
reproductions from two of Blake's early "illuminated books" in
"illuminated printing," as he labeled them. The reproductions were
lightly encoded (in HTML only) and accompanied by little contextual
information, with no search capabilities. The Archive now contains
fully searchable and scalable electronic editions of many copies of
Blake's illuminated books in the context of full, up-to-date
bibliographic information about each image, carefully edited
transcriptions of all texts, detailed descriptions of all images, and
extensive bibliographies of Blake's works and scholarship
about Blake. This expansion has also seen the inclusion of examples of
Blake's other work&#8212;commercial book illustrations, separate
prints, drawings and paintings, and manuscripts&#8212;as well as a
searchable electronic version of David V. Erdman's <i>The
Complete Poetry and
Prose of William Blake</i>, the standard printed edition for
reference. </p>

      <p>Meanwhile, the roster of
major contributors has grown to encompass
every major Blake collection in the world: the Library of Congress (now
a sponsor) has been joined by the Huntington Library and Art Gallery;
the Essick Collection; the New York Public Library; the Morgan Library
and Museum, New York; the Houghton Library and Fogg Museum of Art at
Harvard; the Yale Center for British Art; the Glasgow University
Library; the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge; the British Museum; the
National Gallery of Art, Washington; the National Gallery of Victoria,
Melbourne; the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; the Museum of Fine
Arts, Boston; the Birmingham Museums and Art Gallery; the Whitworth Art
Gallery, Manchester; the Victoria and Albert Museum; the British
Library; the Tate Collection; the Louvre Museum; the Ashmolean Museum,
Oxford; the Bodleian Library, Oxford; the J. Paul Getty Museum; the
Royal Institution of Cornwall; and the Victoria Library at the
University of Toronto (see <a href="https://www.blakearchive.org/public/institutions.html" target="_blank">Contributing
Collections</a>). Our success to
date in obtaining the confidence and goodwill of owners has reassured
us that a rather vast undertaking such as ours is possible at the
present time. As it is difficult to know how long present opportunities
will last, we are pressing forward now. </p>

      <p>Further acknowledgement
of the significance of the Blake Archive as a
progressive scholarly and pedagogical enterprise has come from the
Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities at the University
of Virginia, which first perceived the value of undertaking such a
challenging project; the Getty Grant Program, which provided major
funding for the first phase of design and construction; and the
Preservation and Access Division of the National Endowment for the
Humanities, which helped to fund our second phase. We have
benefited from additional grants from the Paul Mellon Centre for
Studies in British Art, London, and the University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill, in addition to software and hardware contributions from
Sun Microsystems and Inso Corporation. Our headquarters and source of
major support since 2007 is the Carolina Digital Library and Archives
(CDLA) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,
significantly reinforced by the Department of English at the University
of Rochester.</p>

      <p><strong>Scholarship</strong>:
The Archive had its origins in the fortunate confluence of
four phenomena during one brief span of time in the early 1990s: the
completion of a broad base of mature Blake scholarship, capped by the
publication of the first trustworthy map of the history of Blake's
illuminated book production; the appearance of technology sufficiently
revolutionary to alter some fundamental assumptions in scholarly
editing; the emergence of new technical standards sufficiently robust
to check, if not eliminate, the formidable threat of overnight
obsolescence for large undertakings such as ours; and, finally, the
creation of organizations specifically devoted to giving digital form
to the ideas of humanists. Together these four developments combined to
provide the cornerstone of integrated archival, editorial, and
educational initiatives that would have been impossible ten years, and
probably too risky even five years, earlier.</p>

      <p>Despite decades of
scholarship, the knowledge of Blake's work was
fragmentary and unsystematic until the final quarter of the twentieth
century, partly because the upturn in his reputation came so long after
his death but largely because the study of Blake has often split into
distinct institutional compartments. Literary critics and art
historians operate with different assumptions, values, aims, and
procedures even when investigating the same original materials, as they
were in this case. The resulting lack of coordination delayed the
appearance of the standard tools of reference and reproduction that
represent what we know about Blake, a printmaker and painter who was
also an author.</p>

      <p>But by the late 1980s the
standard points of reference had at last
fallen into place: reliable printed editions of the poetry, prose, and
letters (Bentley 1978, Erdman 1982); excellent, if rare and expensive,
facsimiles of one (but only one) of each of Blake's illuminated books
(Blake Trust-Trianon Press facsimiles, 1951-1976); documentary records
of the life (Bentley 1969, 1988); and sound catalogues of the major
categories of Blake's oeuvre, including the drawings and paintings
(Butlin 1981), illuminated books and secondary criticism (Bentley 1977,
1995), complete graphic works (Bindman 1978), separate plates (Essick
1983), and commercial engravings (Essick 1991), augmented by numerous
subsidiary catalogues that fill out the picture of Blake's multifaceted
productive life. However, the crucial piece of this foundation that
concerned Blake's illuminated books was weakened by errors that had
generated a history of false inference and an essentially false overall
picture. In 1993, building on the work of Robert N. Essick and G. E.
Bentley, Jr. but reassessing the fundamental evidence, Joseph Viscomi's
      <i>Blake and the Idea of the Book</i> redrew the map
of Blake's productions in
his most famous and difficult medium, illuminated printing. This
indispensable if uncoordinated legacy of scholarship in disparate
disciplines set the stage for a new phase of radical editorial revision
of a kind that would be almost unimaginable in the medium of print.</p>

      <p><strong>Technology</strong>:
The technology that held the most promise in such a case
was of course global network computing via the Internet and World Wide
Web, which made it possible to conceive a long-distance professional
collaboration and an "edition" of Blake that would transcend the
limitations of conventional scholarly editing and, in the process,
render irrelevant the gap between the original works in restricted
collections, the incomplete sets of expensive facsimiles in the rare
book rooms of some large university libraries, and the indispensable
but highly misleading printed editions on which "readers" had relied
for their "Blake" since the Victorian Blake revival.</p>

      <p><strong>Encoding
system</strong>: But we
were wary. Like everyone else in the
humanities, we had seen grand scholarly hopes crucified on the cross of
technological change and instant obsolescence. Not long before we began
thinking seriously about the uses of digital technology, an
unanticipated change in proprietary videodisc technology had pulled the
rug out from under an ambitious scheme to reproduce a substantial
selection of Blake's images at the University of Iowa. The PC-Mac wars
were another reminder of the danger. But the promise of platform
independence and portability represented by the codification of
Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML, the source of the Web's
HTML and later XML) and its scholarly counterpart in the coordinated
standards of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI, 1987-) finally made it
plausible to devote years of work to an electronic scholarly resource
in the humanities.</p>

      <p><strong>Institutional
base</strong>: But the promise of
closing the editorial gap forced
us, as humanists, to face the technological gap: we could half-envision
electronic remedies that we could not execute. At that point, in 1993,
we crossed paths with the new <a href="https://www.iath.virginia.edu/" target="_blank">Institute for Advanced
Technology in the
Humanities
      </a>at the University of Virginia (1992-). IATH's mission,
we
heard, was to help humanists use new information technology in carrying
out their projects by supplying the requisite expertise and equipment
at the research and development stage.</p>

      <p>Our preliminary
discussions with the staff of IATH introduced us to an
exotic new world of markup codes, servers and clients, the Web, and
Java. But the primary consequence was the conception of a William Blake
Archive, which would be a comprehensive but coherent array of
electronic scholarly editions to be made available free of charge on
the Web. We came to believe that, given an elegant design and
sufficiently powerful features&#8212;including an innovative way of
searching for individual details in all the images in addition to the
more conventional searches for specific texts&#8212;our project
would help to set the pattern for serious art-historical and textual
scholarship by electronic means at a key moment in their evolution. For
a large international community of art historians and literary critics,
among others, the Blake Archive would be a powerful reference tool,
offering high-quality reproductions of an important body of
work&#8212;much of it previously unreproduced, badly reproduced, or
reproduced in rare volumes&#8212;and making that work accessible
and usable in new ways that would improve interdisciplinary knowledge
in areas where more and better knowledge was sorely needed.</p>

      <p>Literary critics tend to
favor the illuminated books in their research;
art historians tend to favor paintings, prints, and drawings. While
those disciplinary biases are of course natural and to some extent
inevitable, the price of such specialized attention&#8212;in
understanding the full artistic situation&#8212;has often been
higher than it should be or needs to be. By incorporating as much of
Blake's pictorial and literary canon as possible&#8212;with both
images and texts organized, interlinked, and searchable in ways that
only hypermedia systems will allow&#8212;the Archive would for the
first time give scholars and students access to the major intersections
between the illuminated books and Blake's other creative and commercial
works. That is to say, by exploiting new information technology to
deliver the historical, technical, and aesthetic contexts necessary to
study Blake as printmaker, painter, and poet, the Archive would
encourage a deeper, more responsible understanding of his aims and
methods, which have been regularly misunderstood and misrepresented.</p>

      <p>The concrete results
would be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a large,
searchable hypermedia
archive on the World Wide Web; and</li>

  <li>eventually, once the architecture of the Web-based
archive was
substantially complete and a
broad representation of Blake's work was in place, a series of the
works on portable media such as CD-ROM or DVD-ROM disks.</li>
</ul>

      <p>Both
products would be designed
for use by a broad audience of scholars
and students in their studies, classrooms, and museums. At this time,
portability made disks a popular medium in classrooms and on desktop
computers. But for scholars doing sustained original research, there
would be no adequate substitute for global access to a
platform-independent William Blake Archive published on the Web.</p>

      <p>Thus all along our
fundamental aim has been to construct a unified
international resource out of highly disparate and dispersed original
materials to which access is ordinarily limited by institutional and
other restrictions and by the sheer cost and difficulty of travel. As a
public resource, the Blake Archive would be maintained free and open to
all those who have access to the Web anywhere. We hoped we could
persuade major collectors and collections of Blake material to agree to
contribute their works to the Archive in precisely that public spirit,
especially considering that very few works by Blake are on permanent
exhibition due to concern about the effects of handling and excessive
exposure to light. Several major institutional collections had severely
limited even scholars' access to the fragile originals. This included
at least two of our contributors, the Huntington and the Fitzwilliam.
Both institutions had disbound and/or rebound several illuminated books
in an attempt to improve preservation. Our contribution to these
attempts at preservation is very direct: by making available searchable
and sizeable images of the highest quality, we can provide access
without compromising preservation in any way. Institutions that
contribute to the Archive can continue to provide scholars and the
public full access to these treasures while at the same time taking all
necessary measures to preserve the originals. As a curator wrote to us,
"I look forward to viewing [his institution's illuminated books]. You
will probably know that we have now made a link from our web pages to
the Blake Archive so that users can easily view our copies rather than
over-tax the originals. With a fast-enough machine they come up almost
instantaneously." </p>

      <p>Once archived digitally,
structured and tagged (indexed for retrieval
in SGML&#8212;and now in XML&#8212;adapted to the purpose),
annotated with detailed
descriptions, and orchestrated with a powerful search engine (in this
case DynaWeb software), the images in the Archive could be examined
like ordinary color reproductions. But they could also be searched
alongside the texts, enlarged, computer enhanced, juxtaposed in
numerous combinations, and otherwise manipulated to investigate
features (such as the etched basis of the designs and texts) that had
heretofore been imperceptible without close first-hand scrutiny of the
far-flung original works. For example, the information necessary for
doing good art history would enable scholars and students to draw sound
conclusions about the differences between what Blake etched on his
copper plates and what was added or changed afterwards in printing and
coloring the impressions. But the published reproductions upon which
much art-historical study necessarily depends simply cannot record such
details with sufficient accuracy. Even scholars who are able to
globetrot from collection to collection end up relying heavily upon
their inadequate memories, notes, xeroxes, and photographs to
compensate for the distances in time and space between collections.
Seeing the originals is good in itself; but seeing them in fine,
trustworthy reproductions, in context and in relation to one another,
is the scholarly ideal. Difficulty of access to originals and reliance
on inadequate reproductions have handicapped and distorted even the
best efforts. Again, the inevitable result has all too frequently been
distortions of the record, misconstructions, and the waste of
considerable scholarly labor.</p>

      <p>We began by tackling the
multitude of challenges presented by a single
category of Blake's work, his illuminated books. The illuminated books
had their genesis in a series of graphic experiments that Blake began
around 1788 and quickly evolved into a program of combining visual and
textual elements in printed pages that he could
control&#8212;design, write, etch, print, and
color&#8212;himself. Though he produced a great deal of important
work in other media, the illuminated books (c. 1788-1827) span most of
his productive life and reflect its characteristic patterns. These
much-discussed books are fundamental to his artistic reputation for
several good reasons: they are spectacular examples of the illustrated
book at one extreme of its development; fascinating explorations of the
interactions between texts and designs at a level of narrative maturity
seldom matched and never exceeded; major instances of the
transformations of traditional iconography in the late eighteenth
century; and central documents in British romanticism, both as
historical period and as ideology.</p>

      <p>In his lifetime, Blake
produced about 175 copies of his 19 illuminated
books. About 20% of those&#8212;40 or so&#8212;have been
reproduced in print, sometimes well, sometimes execrably, but in no
coherent historical order. By the end of the first phase of our
project, in June 2000, we had reproduced 41 copies, about half of which
had never been reproduced before. This constituted, for the first time,
an archive of reproductions suitable for serious research. Only since
the mid-1990s, largely as a result of Viscomi's extensive research, has
the history of the production of the illuminated books been correctly
understood. That in turn made possible for the first time a rigorously
constructed scholarly archive, including numerous copies of the
illuminated books that had been neglected because their place in the
history of production was not understood.</p>

      <p>Our next task was to add
drawings; paintings; and several kinds of
prints, manuscripts, and rare or unique typographical works to the
Archive. Doing so yields an augmented "Blake" considerably larger than
the one most familiar to students and scholars, especially those who
approach Blake from the literary side. Without sacrificing the Blake of
the <i>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</i> and <i>The
Marriage of Heaven and
Hell</i>, the extended Archive reveals the painter-printmaker
whose
illuminated books emerged from the materials, work routines, and
imagery of eighteenth-century history painting, water color drawing,
and graphic arts, as well as from the literary routines of Milton, the
Bible, Swedenborg, and Boehme, which students of Blake have more often
investigated. Commercial illustrations, for example, can bring into
focus a major convergence between Blake's illuminated book <i>Visions
of
the Daughters of Albion</i> (1793) and his engravings to J. G.
Stedman's
      <i>Narrative, of a Five Years' Expedition, against the
Revolted Negroes of
Surinam</i> (etched 1791). Even the familiar profile of a
poet-Blake can be
deepened by the inclusion of Blake's extensive group of literary
illustrations, such as those to the Bible and to the poems of Dante,
Milton, Gray, Blair, and Young, among others.</p>

      <p>We have come to see the
Blake project as a pacesetting instance of a
fundamental shift in the ideas of "archive," "catalogue," and "edition"
as both processes and products. Though "edition" and "archive" are the
terms we have fallen back on, in fact we have envisioned a
resource unlike any other currently available&#8212;a hybrid
all-in-one edition, catalogue, database, and set of scholarly tools
capable of taking full advantage of the opportunities offered by new
information technology.</p>

      <p><strong>Uses
of the Blake Archive as a prototype</strong>:
The Blake Archive is not
designed to be an isolated resource. We foresee a time when it will be
only one of very many cooperating electronic resources for scholarly
research. Thus we have been members of the groundbreaking <a href="https://www.nines.org/" target="_blank">NINES</a>
(Networked Infrastructure for Nineteenth-Century Electronic
Scholarship) consortium from its inception in 2003. But until the
standards for such resources evolve, projects like ours must be in the
business of setting standards by designing prototype tools and
techniques. A guiding aim of our project is to solve problems with
methods that are widely applicable. The collaborative procedures we are
developing, which we hope will become useful prototypes of "distance
editing," depend upon intensive day-to-day teamwork among the three
editors and the staff of CDLA to integrate the textual, art-historical,
critical, and technical expertise necessary for the construction of a
scholarly resource as complex as this one.</p>

      <p>We see the products of
our collaboration as similarly prototypical: in
facing new technical and editorial challenges, the Blake Archive will
make available new tools for future archivers, editors, and
cataloguers. The Document Type Definition (DTD) developed by the Text
Encoding Initiative (TEI) has become the default standard for encoding
text-based projects in the humanities. We believe that the Blake
Archive DTD has the potential to become the standard for encoded
electronic images, as the TEI has for encoded electronic texts. In this
image-oriented non-TEI DTD&#8212;an art historian's DTD if you
will&#8212;we are constructing the most comprehensive <i>applied</i>
product of its kind, one robust and flexible enough to be adapted
readily to the needs of many other projects that use images
extensively. In addition, software developed by IATH, such as our Java
applets Inote and ImageSizer, is adaptable to virtually any project in
which images are important.</p>

      <p>The perception that our
editorial and technical experience is directly
relevant to other projects has generated steadily increasing interest
in the Archive that has nothing to do with Blake per se. Hence, for
example, we have been invited to speak at numerous meetings where the
subject was not Blake but humanities computing or editorial theory.</p>

      <p>Because the signal
advantage of electronic editing and cataloguing is
the open-endedness that makes it possible to add materials, correct
errors, incorporate new discoveries, and construct new relationships,
we have believed from the first that our principal
objective&#8212;the most significant contribution we can hope to
make&#8212;should be the creation of a sound and durable foundation
for decades of future scholarship. Since 1995, when the Getty Grant
Program underwrote the initial phase of our project, we have worked to
shape the foundations of the Archive in strict accordance with our
original ideals and priorities.</p>

History</b> </h2>

      <p><strong>Background,
1991-1994</strong>: In
1991-93, at work on two
printed volumes in a
new series published by the Blake Trust, Tate Gallery, and Princeton
University Press (see <a href="https://www.blakearchive.org/public/about/principles/index.html" target="_blank">Editorial
Principles</a>), we came face to
face with
the limitations of even lavishly illustrated books for the kind of
Blake edition we had envisioned and began to conceive the outlines of
an electronic edition that might overcome many of these limitations.</p>

      <p>With this in mind, at the
urging of Jerome McGann we visited IATH in
the summer of 1993 to see his <a href="https://www.rossettiarchive.org/" target="_blank">Rossetti
project</a> (see "The Rossetti
            Archive and Image-Based Electronic Editing," 1996; "<a href="https://www2.iath.virginia.edu/jjm2f/rationale.htm" target="_blank">The
Rationale of
Hypertext</a>," 1997; and "<a href="https://www2.iath.virginia.edu/jjm2f/old/chum.html" target="_blank">Imagining
What You Don't Know: The Theoretical
Goals of the Rossetti Archive</a>,"
1998) and to meet with the staff of the
Institute, including John Unsworth, who was the new director. After
extensive discussions and demonstrations, we concluded not only that
our concept of a rather primitive electronic edition was technically
feasible but also that a scholarly resource far more ambitiously
transformative was within the realm of possibility.</p>

      <p>In 1994 we applied to
become Associate Networked Fellows of IATH and
drew up a preliminary proposal for a Blake
"archive"&#8212;appropriating McGann's term for our somewhat
different purposes&#8212;in three major phases that would tackle,
first, the difficulties presented by the illuminated books; second, the
remaining categories of work in Blake's oeuvre (prints, paintings,
drawings, manuscripts); and, third, such issues as secondary
publication (on disks), interpretive supplementary material, and
educational applications. A great deal of further planning over the
course of the year developed this initial proposal into the original
blueprint for the Archive.</p>

      <p><strong>Blake
Archive, phase one, 1994-2000</strong>:
In 1995 we received a grant from
the Getty Grant Program to underwrite the initial three years of
planning and execution focused on the illuminated books. The Blake
project was the first opportunity for IATH to work intensively with
researchers from outside the University of Virginia community. The
Institute provided the team with full-scale technical assistance and
archive-design consultation, along with the necessary equipment to
establish the foundations of the Archive.</p>

      <p><strong>Year
1, 1995-96</strong>: The Institute
phase of the project began with Joseph
Viscomi as a resident fellow for the year. With our first project
manager, Amy Sexton, and a student technical assistant in place, the
three editors met with IATH staff in the summer of 1995&#8212;in
retrospect, the first "Blake camp," as we came to call these annual
planning and problem-solving sessions. We drew up a two-phase plan with
illuminated books in the first phase and non-illuminated works in the
second. At the end of the second phase the architecture of the Blake
Archive would be complete and all its wings would have substantial
content.</p>

      <p>We settled easily into
our division of labor as an outgrowth of the
editors' experience with the Blake Trust volumes. We would make all
final decisions collectively. We would deal with institutions according
to our individual experience with them. Beyond that, Eaves and Essick
would share major responsibility for generating the bibliographical
information and image descriptions. Viscomi would take major
responsibility for generating digital images and transcriptions of
Blake's texts. Among other duties&#8212;parsing the SGML markup,
moving works from testing to publication, etc.&#8212;the project
manager would coordinate activities at IATH, including our project's
access to the technical staff. Everyone would proofread and test.</p>

      <p>We compiled a prioritized
list of illuminated books (for our principles
of selection, see <a href="https://www.blakearchive.org/public/about/principles/index.html" target="_blank">Editorial
Principles</a>) and began to seek
cooperation
from key collections of Blake material. After reading and consultation
that included sessions with a member of the Getty/MESL (Museum
Educational Site Licensing) project in digital imaging, we conducted
extensive trials to determine the
optimum balance of photographic
format, scanning resolution, and file size for an archive of this type.
Key benchmarks were arrived at (see <a href="https://www.blakearchive.org/public/about/principles/index.html" target="_blank">Editorial
Principles</a>), and enough
fundamental design work was completed
to move us to the next stage. We
established blake-proj, the online discussion group that has proven
essential to the collaboration that has been a hallmark of the
Archive's development (see Morris Eaves, "<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=jep;view=text;rgn=main;idno=3336451.0003.202" target="_blank">Behind
the Scenes at the
William Blake Archive: Collaboration Takes More Than E-Mail</a>,"
      <i>The
Journal of Electronic Publishing</i>
3.2 (Dec. 1997).</p>

      <p>By the end of the
inaugural year we had concluded
agreements with four
contributors that control access to thousands of Blake's images: the
Library of Congress (which became our official co-sponsor), the
Huntington Library and Art Galleries, Glasgow University Library in
Scotland, and the Essick Collection, the largest collection of Blake
and his followers in private hands. The editors personally supervised a
six-day photographic session at the Library of Congress that yielded
620 images. All the new photography was in our benchmark format, 4" x
5" color transparencies with color bars and gray scales.</p>

      <p>During the year we made
our first public outings. We presented our
plans at the Society for Textual Studies meeting in New York and did
our first demonstration (using mockups) at the meeting of the Society
for Documentary Editing in Baltimore. Finally, we opened a Web version
of the Blake Archive to the public with two copies each of Blake's <i>Book
of Thel</i> and <i>Visions of the Daughters of Albion</i>,
using the first version
of our page design, lightly coded in HTML only, with no search
capabilities or Java applets.</p>

      <p><strong>Year
2, 1996-97</strong>: In retrospect
this was a make-or-break year. At the
second summer Blake camp we discussed our goals: to pursue negotiations
with additional major collections; to complete the first version of the
Blake Archive DTD&#8212;the Document Type Definition (DTD) for the
SGML-encoded illuminated books; to add search capabilities for images
as well as for texts; and to ready for testing a single work for
publication in something approaching a fully operative form. New
hardware (a server), software (DynaWeb, a search engine), and technical
support were donated by Sun Microsystems and Inso Corporation.</p>

      <p>A major initial challenge
was to find a system to base our image
searches on. We began by giving careful consideration to two leading
candidates. "Computer vision" or "pattern recognition" searches attempt
to identify objects in digitized images by recognizing patterns (wheat
vs. waves). Controlled-vocabulary searches operate by assigning words
to pictures (sheep, Urizen, finger, contrapposto). The most formidable
iconographic classification system is Iconclass, developed by a Leiden
art historian, Henri van der Waal, and published after his death in 17
volumes, 1973-85.</p>

      <p>Computer vision is a
fascinating research subject in computer labs but,
we quickly discovered, completely incapable of making the precise
discriminations we had in mind. Iconclass is more
capable&#8212;with the advantage of being a published point of
reference. But though it aspires to be a universal system of image
description, Iconclass was first used to describe medieval and
Renaissance iconography, and it is still best suited to images that are
typical of a certain school of art. Its classifications are
very different from our intricate descriptions of individual images and
their numerous components. </p>

      <p>Blake's works are full of
unconventional elements. His uniqueness and
the specificity of Blake studies require a more detailed and precise
semantics, we concluded, than a general system like Iconclass provides.
Thus we set out to develop our own controlled vocabulary of descriptive
terms empirically, in the course of describing the images for the first
time&#8212;a procedure we have followed throughout the project with
excellent results, we believe. We remain open to alternatives, however.</p>

      <p>We decided to incorporate
two significant reference works: an extensive
bibliography of works useful in the study of Blake and David V.
Erdman's standard printed edition, <i>The Complete Poetry and
Prose of
William Blake</i> (complete with Erdman's textual notes). We
published the
first bibliography in 1997. The Erdman edition presented more
formidable challenges, including a separate TEI-compliant DTD. The
first round of encoding was completed in 1997, but, in order to create
a searchable text, integrated with the rest of the Archive, a good deal
of further work was required. (We tested two early versions and
published early in 2000.)</p>

      <p>A sophisticated final
design for the site, complete with search engine
and a Java applet, Inote, was refined over several months of
discussion, experiment, testing, and revision. Inote, a tool designed
at IATH for image viewing and annotation, was integrated with the
search engine to zoom in automatically on particular visual details and
display the editors' descriptions in image searches. We decided that
users must also have a way of controlling the size of images. The
result was ImageSizer, a second Java applet, which allows a user to
view images at their original size or to enlarge and reduce them at
will.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, the three
editors at their separate outposts and the project
manager and technical assistant at IATH proceeded according to the
division of labor that had been worked out the previous year. Digital
scanning, painstaking image-by-image color correction on specialized
professional equipment, and elaborate SGML markup of all images began
in earnest. As always, the Archive discussion group blake-proj remained
the place where all momentous and trivial issues were hashed out. In
addition, we created a work-in-progress Web site (our WIP site),
accessible by password, where we could conduct all our pre-publication
testing.</p>

      <p>During the year we made
public presentations of the Archive in New
York; Washington, DC; New Haven; Cambridge, UK; and Oxford, UK. We also
reached final agreements with two new contributors, the New York Public
Library and the Yale Center for British Art, and continued the process
of acquiring and scanning 4" x 5" transparencies as we approached other
major repositories.</p>

      <p><strong>Years
3-4, 1997-99</strong>: Whatever
remained unresolved in our usual
forums&#8212;the work-in-progress site and blake-proj&#8212;was
moved onto
the agenda of our third Blake camp, where we were able to get to the
bottom of thorny problems&#8212;the logic of searches, the
operation of Inote, the consistency of displays, the structure of the
SGML hierarchy, editorial formats&#8212;that were blocking the
first publication of a fully searchable and resizable work in the
Archive. After two months of intensive tweaking and testing, we added a
detailed <a href="https://www.blakearchive.org/help/help.html" target="_blank">Help</a>
document and opened the new site to the public in August
1997 with a single work, <i>The Book of Thel</i> copy F,
from the Library of
Congress&#8212;a mere eight plates but, as far as we were
concerned, a landmark.</p>

      <p>We determined that
1997-99 were to be years of production and
publication that would move us toward the primary goal we specified in
the original plan: to publish at least one copy of each of Blake's 19
illuminated books, along with multiple copies of several books. As of
June 1998, 23 copies of 13 books had been published; as of June 1999,
33 copies of 18 books had been published. (For information on the
significance of individual copies, see <a href="https://www.blakearchive.org/public/all-updates.html" target="_blank">Blake
Archive Updates</a>).</p>

      <p>In early 1999 we also added a new wing to the site. <a href="https://www.blakearchive.org/public/about/index.html" target="_blank">About
the Archive</a>
made available a large body of documentation and supplementary
material: the Archive at a Glance (for a quick overview), Editorial
Principles, a Technical Summary, a detailed Plan of the Archive,
Frequently Asked Questions, and a list of published scholarship about
the Archive along with published reviews of the project. In June 1999
we added a long-anticipated Tour of the Archive. Through a sequence of
several dozen graphical screenshots linked to narrative commentary, the
Tour introduces users to the basic organization and structure of the
Archive, the features of its interface, its search options, and the
function of the Inote and ImageSizer applications. Since then, we have
continued to revise and expand About the Archive.</p>

      <p>During these years we
reached agreements with the Pierpont Morgan
Library, New York; the Houghton Library, Harvard University; and the
Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge University. We were well along in the
process of acquiring the necessary photographs from these collections,
some by generous loans of file transparencies, others by new
photography: at the Morgan Library, for instance, the editors
supervised a three-day photographic session that produced 255 images.
In 1997-98 the Archive received a modest grant from the Paul Mellon
Centre for the Study of British Art, London, the first ever given by
the Mellon Centre in support of an electronic project. We gave public
presentations of the project on several occasions (see <a href="https://www.blakearchive.org/public/presentations.html" target="_blank">Presentations
and Demonstrations about the Archive</a>);
a well-attended session on romanticism at the
annual MLA meeting (San Francisco, Dec. 1998) eventuated in the
publication of several papers on the Archive (<i>Wordsworth
Circle</i> 30.3 (summer 1999);
            see <a href="https://www.blakearchive.org/public/about/articles/index.html" target="_blank">Articles
about the Archive</a>).</p>

      <p><strong>Year
5, 1999-2000</strong>: We spent the
year consolidating our gains and
preparing to initiate, in 2000-03, a second phase of development.</p>

      <p>Matthew Kirschenbaum, who
had served as our project manager while a
graduate student at the University of Virginia, became our technical
editor when he moved to his new faculty position in humanities research
computing at the University of Kentucky (since 2001, at the University
of Maryland). Kirschenbaum's appointment, one of the first of its kind
in the nation, allowed him to continue overseeing the technical
development of the project in collaboration with IATH, while also
working to refine some of its potential contributions to humanities
computing and digital libraries, such as the Archive's prototypes for
searching and manipulating structured image-based data and the
expansion of the Archive's DTD into a more generalized resource usable
by other projects.</p>

      <p>After final testing, we
published our TEI-compliant, searchable
electronic version of David Erdman's edition of <i>The Complete
Poetry and
Prose of William Blake</i>, which had been in production for more
than
three years.</p>

      <p>We continued publishing
additional copies of illuminated books in order
to clear our second hurdle: after publishing one copy of every
illuminated book, to publish at least one copy of every printing of
every book, according to the historical rationale that sets our
priorities (see <a href="https://www.blakearchive.org/public/about/principles/index.html" target="_blank">Editorial
Principles</a>). We also added
multiple copies of
works from several printings&#8212;mostly copies that have seldom
or never been reproduced or reproduced badly&#8212;and began to
create the structure that would eventually allow us to incorporate
related materials that help to document the history of production in
context (individual proofs, early states, sketches, associated
drawings, prints, and paintings).</p>

      <p>The last illuminated book
to be represented in the Archive, Blake's
100-plate <i>Jerusalem</i>
(copy E, the only complete colored copy, from the
Yale Center for British Art), continued to serve, while in development
for several years, as an object of editorial inquiry that led gradually
to major changes in our protocols.</p>

      <p>Our newly convened
advisory board&#8212;a broad group of museum
curators, art historians, textual critics, romanticists, authorities in
humanities computing, and Blake scholars&#8212;agreed to
participate in the testing of new works at our work-in-progress site.
To facilitate communication, we set up a new online discussion group
for them.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, we reviewed
our procedures for reproducing images in
discussions with experts in image compression at the University of
Rochester, Kodak, and Xerox, including members of the international
team that developed JPEG 2000 (see <a href="https://www.blakearchive.org/public/about/tech/index.html" target="_blank">Technical
Summary</a>).</p>

      <p>Finally, of course, we
continued to acquire additional works from our
contributing institutions and to establish cooperation with others. But
we already had access to more than enough material to represent very
amply the artistic range of Blake and his contemporaries. We also
presented our project in a variety of public forums in cities including
Dublin,
Ireland; Charlottesville, Virginia; and Halifax, Nova Scotia.</p>

      <p><strong>Phase
two, 2000-03</strong>: As our
initial three-year funding from the Getty
Grant Program allowed us to initiate the first (five-year) phase of our
work, an NEH Preservation and Access grant allowed us to initiate a new
phase of development with three principal aims: to continue adding
illuminated books to the Archive; to extend the image-oriented Blake
Archive DTD and stylesheets to accommodate the other categories of
Blake's works; and to incorporate a significant representation of work
from these categories into the new wings of the Archive, including a
preview wing&#8212;a provisional area that would allow a more
expeditious movement of works from the editorial pipeline into the
Archive proper. In the process, we aimed to greatly increase the size
of the Archive and make it fully representative of the range of Blake's
work. </p>

      <p>We began by assessing the
requirements, scholarly and technical, of
each category of work required to complete the structure of the
Archive: prints (original and reproductive), paintings, drawings,
manuscripts, and typographical works. From that assessment flowed the
design for our original SGML architecture. Although we started with the
illuminated books because they required us to address the problems of
both texts and pictures (discrete, juxtaposed, and fused), the other
categories of Blake's oeuvre are distinct in important respects. For
instance, the illuminated books are book-like in scale; none is as
small as Blake's smallest works or as large as his largest paintings.
The issue of scale&#8212;to take only that one&#8212;raises
art-historical questions (should we continue to privilege the actual
size of the images?) and technical questions (should we limit the use
of ImageSizer or extend its capabilities?) that we have had to deal
with. The task at hand was to anticipate changes in the DTD and
stylesheets, interface, image descriptions, and art-historical and
textual information, and arrive at an initial set of blueprints that
would allow us to add new subcategories of Blake's work to the Archive.</p>

      <p>Much of the work of the
            second phase was behind the scenes&#8212;making
editorial changes, creating prototypes, and running tests. These were
precursors to basic revisions of the elements in the DTD on which the
Archive rested. We adopted a radical documentary-style line-numbering
scheme capable of accommodating not just conventional printed literary
texts, such as poetry, but any text&#8212;inscriptions, labels on engravings,
signatures and imprints on engravings, monograms, and numbers. We
revised the stylesheets that control the display of works, and we
modified the "copy headers" and "object headers" that deliver
fundamental bibliographical information about the images to the user.
We also implemented new transcription standards in the display of
several of Blake's works. These standards attempted to adhere to the
shape of Blake's text more closely than we were previously able to
reproduce in a digital medium. New servers installed at IATH in 2003
noticeably improved access times, which were increasingly important as
the Archive continued to expand the number of works on the site and as
more users came to the site.</p>

      <p>Along with the redesign
and extension of the DTD came problems of
rendering and description&#8212;how to render images across various
new categories in ways that would be coherent with the rest of the
Archive and yet remain faithful to the images themselves. Blake's work
beyond the illuminated-book canon includes the drawings, paintings, and
prints to which the artist devoted most of his productive life, along
with important typographical works and manuscripts. Although the
Archive has been designed with the aim of accommodating all of Blake's
work (and, for that matter, the work of his contemporaries as well),
these additional categories have required special attention at each
stage: scanning and correcting line engravings, for instance, present
new technical problems, such as a tendency toward optical distortion in
areas of close crosshatching, that we have had to solve; single
"paintings," separate "plates," and continuous "pages" of type involve
us in structural relations distinct from those characteristic of the
illuminated books. Similarly, we have been working out protocols for
describing images that are in many respects unlike the images of the
illuminated books for which our controlled vocabulary was developed.</p>

      <p>We addressed these
problems in the process of publishing two extensive
bodies of work that we identified as the most logical extensions of the
Archive: Blake's illustrations (in several media) to the Book of Job
and to the poetry of John Milton (almost 200 items). (Users
had written us asking for Blake's designs to Job, Milton, and Dante.)
These images, which are often historically, thematically, and formally
related to the illuminated books, meet two criteria of "significance":
they are representative of Blake's oeuvre as a whole, and they are
among the works most often studied by Blake scholars. Hence they
constituted a logical, large, but manageable first extension of what we
had already done. The Huntington, one of our contributors, holds the
world's largest collection of Blake's illustrations to the works of
Milton.</p>

      <p>Our second phase involved
the difficult transition from a specialized
to a generalized framework: from one capable of supporting a
specialized collection (of illuminated books) to one capable of
supporting a far broader combination of texts and images, plus
extensive information about them and robust scholarly tools to
manipulate them. Obviously, it is hard to predict in advance exactly
where that broadening must occur: thus the prototypes and trial runs,
which have a way of turning up unexpected anomalies. We chose Blake's
engraved <i>Illustrations
of the Book of Job</i>, one of
his masterpieces, because the
basic configuration of image and text in the Job plates is different
from that of the illuminated books&#8212;and thus presents
different display problems&#8212;and because the images themselves
are often very dense and crowded with elaborate details.</p>

      <p>Non-illuminated materials
present several editorial
challenges&#8212;from convoluted transcriptions featuring multiple
foreign-character sets to large images requiring adjustments to our
scaling equations&#8212;and several technical challenges. These
challenges led us to create an entirely new wing of the Archive.
Technical development began in late summer 2001 and was completed in
early winter 2002 with the publication of water color illustrations to
the Book of Job in February 2002. Work completed during that time laid
a foundation for the publication of a broad range of non-illuminated
materials, including a set of Blake's engraved <i>Illustrations
of the
Book of Job</i>; manuscripts
associated with Blake's
illustrations to Milton's
"L'Allegro" and "Il
Penseroso"; commercial book illustrations designed by Blake
to Robert Blair's <i>The Grave</i>;
and water color illustrations to
Milton's "On the Morning of Christ's
Nativity" and <i>Paradise Regained</i>.
These were published in our
new preview mode, devised in the interest of publishing the greatest
number of high-quality images in the shortest span of time. Like all
other items in the Archive, works in preview are in full and accurate
color, with enlargements, and with searchable transcriptions of any
texts, including even the briefest of inscriptions. The only functions
unavailable in preview are image
search and Inote.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, we published
additional copies of illuminated books in order
to clear another hurdle: after publishing one copy of every illuminated
book (in 2003 with the 100-plate <i>Jerusalem</i>
copy E), to publish at least
one copy of every <i>printing</i>
of every book. We added <i>America</i>
copy O; <i>Europe</i>
copy K; <i>The Marriage of Heaven
and Hell</i> copy G; <i>Visions
of the
Daughters of Albion</i> copy P; and <i>The
[First] Book of Urizen</i> copies A,
B,
C, and F. We also added a biography, glossary, and chronology in a new
wing of the Archive, <a href="https://www.blakearchive.org/about-blake.html" target="_blank">About
Blake</a>. The biography, by Denise
Vultee with
the editors, offers extensive background information on Blake's life
and works with over 100 accompanying illustrations. The glossary, by
Alexander S. Gourlay, treats terms, names, and concepts in Blake that
can be mystifying. The chronology covers important dates in Blake's
life, including publications and places of residence. The biography and
glossary were both encoded in XML to assure conformity with the rest of
the Archive. Additionally, we loaded all the data from our
image-production records into a new database in order to track our
workflow as the Archive expanded. </p>

      <p>By the end of 2003 the
Archive had incorporated a full range of
drawings, paintings, and prints from a rapidly expanding circle of 19
international collections. We had acquired for publication 4415 images,
including at least one copy of every illuminated book and in many cases
multiple copies, as well as a large number of Blake's paintings,
drawings, engravings, manuscripts, and typographical works. Three
labor-intensive years of final design work, scanning, encoding, and
acquisition of new materials helped to ensure the success of the
Archive as originally conceived. In 2003 the Archive received the
MLA's Prize for a Distinguished Scholarly Edition, the first
time the prize was awarded to an electronic edition.</p>

      <p><strong>Phase
three, 2004-09</strong>: In
expanding beyond the illuminated books, we
have generally been guided by the following priorities: original works
in coherent series that are closely related to the illuminated books
already present in the Archive, individual items closely related to
those works in turn, works in significant subcategories where we can
provide a large and representative sample, the commercial prints
(separate and in series, first those designed and engraved by Blake,
then those designed by Blake, followed finally by those engraved by
Blake), manuscripts (such as letters, unpublished drafts, and
Blake's Notebook), and typographical works. </p>

      <p>This
approach&#8212;expanding coherently from the core
outward&#8212;dominated the first phase of our development and has
continued to dominate subsequent phases, as it must if we are to
maximize the usefulness of the Archive to students and scholars. We
stress, however, that this pattern of growth, useful as it is, has not
been adopted out of any sense that the illuminated books are primary
and the remaining work secondary. Far from it: one of our major goals
is to contribute to a reassessment of such conventional assumptions. In
the past, what has counted as primary or secondary among art historians
and literary critics has depended far too heavily on the very
restrictions (of access, of disciplinary perspective) that we want to
reduce if not eliminate in the name of a fuller understanding. The new
means of access we have provided, such as powerful image-searching
capabilities, are most valuable to users when searches are conducted
across related bodies of material. In emphasizing that kind of breadth,
we are not ignoring the competing criterion of
representativeness&#8212;and the tension between depth and breadth
can be productive. We believe that our approach stands the best chance
of serving both needs at once. That is, the Archive will steadily
become more representative as it becomes more extensive but at the
least possible sacrifice of utilitarian coherence. We are always aware
of the dangers of mere sampling, however extensive, perhaps because the
World Wide Web itself offers so many unsettling object lessons.</p>

      <p>The third phase of
development consolidated and significantly extended
the earlier work, expanded the number of contributing collections to 27
and the number of digital images to nearly 6000, added contextual
materials, completed a lengthy but necessary conversion of the site
from SGML to XML, and set a rigorous publication schedule. We moved to
a new base of operations at the University of North Carolina at Chapel
Hill and established a manuscript team at the University of Rochester
and a close working relationship with Rochester's <i>Blake/An
Illustrated
Quarterly</i>. In 2005
the Modern Language
Association's Committee on Scholarly Editions awarded its
Approved Edition seal to the Archive, the first time an electronic
scholarly edition received this recognition.</p>

      <p>The slow, painful
conversion from SGML to XML permitted fundamental
changes in site architecture to provide more flexible and sustainable
support for the comprehensive Archive we envisioned. In 2006 we
launched our XML-based Archive. The conversion involved essential
upgrades in technology, an important shift to open-source software, and
a conceptual shift in our organization of Blake's works. Our
experiences with Blake's engravings, color prints, water
colors, and manuscripts led us to reconsider our use of
"non-illuminated works" as an overarching category
to describe works other than illuminated books. We established a new
organizational framework that gives equal weight to various genres and
media within Blake's body of work. On the technical end, our
new XML-based Archive replaced the SGML and DynaWeb-based architecture
that had disseminated the Archive for several years. All works in the
Archive (as well as the editors' bibliographic commentary and
illustration descriptions) are now encoded in XML and stored in a
native XML database powered by eXist. A complex set of XSLT stylesheets
transforms these XML documents into the HTML that is then accessed by
users, delivered by the Apache Cocoon Web development framework (see <a href="https://www.blakearchive.org/public/about/tech/index.html" target="_blank">Technical
Summary</a>).</p>

      <p>In 2007 the Archive moved
its base of operations from IATH at the
University of Virginia to the <a href="https://cdla.unc.edu/" target="_blank">Carolina
Digital Library
and Archives</a>
(CDLA) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. This move
provided far greater scope for our work. Previously we had to
alternate between technical and editorial challenges, and changes
registered slowly. UNC provided the resources to move forward on all
fronts simultaneously.</p>

      <p>That change in pace and
scope allowed us to contemplate major changes
in site design and to establish an ambitious publication schedule that
could be rigorously mapped out well in advance. Publication highlights
in this period included Blake's striking series of
experimental color printed drawings; his water color illustrations to
Thomas Gray's poems, Dante's <i>Divine
Comedy</i> (102 drawings
dispersed among seven institutions), and the poetry of John Milton; a
sketchbook containing drawings for the engraved <i>Illustrations
of the
Book of Job</i>; a manuscript
listing the order of the <i>Songs
of Innocence
and of Experience</i>; engraved
illustrations to Edward Young's <i>Night Thoughts</i>;
and engravings in John Gabriel Stedman's <i>Narrative, of a Five
Years' Expedition, against the
Revolted
Negroes of Surinam</i>. The single
most telling publication may be
Blake's 20 water color drawings for Robert Blair's
poem <i>The Grave</i>,
19 of which
disappeared between their auction in 1836,
their dramatic rediscovery in 2001, and their subsequent resale as
individual drawings to several public and private
collections. Our scholarly edition of the <i>Grave</i>
water colors
thus provides not only a means of integrated access to works that will
be inaccessible as a group of originals for the foreseeable future but
also access to a growing body of related works, such as the engravings
(by Blake and Schiavonetti) based on the water colors.</p>

      <p>We
published numerous significant copies of the illuminated books
during this period: <i>America</i>

      <p>We
            continued to augment and refine our contextual materials. The <a href="https://www.blakearchive.org/about-blake.html" target="_blank">About
Blake</a> section expanded to
include Joseph Viscomi's
"Illuminated Printing," which originally appeared
in <i>The Cambridge Companion to
William Blake</i> (2003). This
electronic
version features additional images that enhance the analysis of
Blake's innovative printing techniques. We revised Editorial
Principles in <a href="https://www.blakearchive.org/public/about/index.html" target="_blank">About
the Archive</a> and published
redesigned and updated
bibliographies and collection lists in our <a href="https://www.blakearchive.org/resources.html" target="_blank">Resources
for Further
Research</a> section. These
resources allow easy access to information
about Blake, his works, and Blake holdings in major collections. Blake
scholar Mark Crosby (Queen's University Belfast) became our official
bibliographer.</p>

      <p>In
its inaugural years, the Archive's new manuscript team
at the University of Rochester has updated many documents in the
Archive, but the team's efforts have focused on a problematic
category of Blake's work, manuscripts and typographical
works, for which we have developed and tested a compact XML tagset
derived from version P5 of the <a href="https://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/" target="_blank">Text Encoding
Initiative (TEI)
Guidelines</a>. This tagset allows
concise but detailed markup of
manuscript features such as cancellations, additions, and
substitutions. </p>

      <p>To
ensure that manuscripts are fully searchable, we use additional TEI
elements (&#60;choice&#62;, &#60;orig&#62;, and
&#60;reg&#62;) to regularize abbreviations
and unconventional
spellings. We have also developed a highly legible color-coding system
capable of displaying at a glance most features of Blake's manuscript
revisions without the clutter of other symbols&#8212;reserving
editors' notes for special cases. </p>

      <p>Rochester
            is also home to a second initiative, the incorporation of <a href="https://www.rochester.edu/college/eng/" target="_blank"><i>Blake/An
Illustrated
Quarterly</i></a> (1968-present) into the Archive, to give
scholars an unprecedented fusion of cross-searchable
"primary" (editorial) and
"secondary" (critical) scholarship. After two years
of preliminary research and consultation, we have produced a plan for
publication that will draw on the open-source XML tagsets created by <i>Digital
Humanities
Quarterly</i> and such impressive
e-journal prototypes
as <a href="https://digitalhumanities.org/dhq/" target="_blank"><i>DHQ</i></a>,
            <a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/research/tateresearch/tatepapers/" target="_blank"><i>Tate
Papers</i></a>,
            and <a href="https://www.ravon.umontreal.ca/" target="_blank"><i>RaVoN</i></a>
(formerly <i>RoN</i>).</p>

Present and Future</b></h2>

      <p>We
continue to depend
upon the system of close
collaboration
we have developed over the years: collectively, the
editors make final decisions about the form and content of the Archive
and control the workflow. At the University of North Carolina, Viscomi
takes major responsibility for acquiring, scanning, and
color-correcting new images on professional equipment designed for the
purpose. Until 2002 Viscomi also transcribed and edited most of the
texts in the Archive. These duties are now performed by Eaves, at the
University of Rochester, and Essick, at the University of California,
Riverside, who also produce XML-encoded descriptions of images and
bibliographical information at various levels (plate or object level,
copy level, series or work level, and so on). Day-to-day progress is
coordinated by our project manager, currently Ashley Reed. For testing,
all the editors collaborate with CDLA staff members&#8212;who are
joined by members of the advisory board.</p>

      <p>Since editorial decisions always have technical
implications,
they must
be arrived at in consultation with the expert staff at CDLA and our
technical editor, William Shaw. The editors participate actively in
discussing all details of execution within their technical reach and
test the practical outcome on the Archive's work-in-progress site. Most
of those ongoing conversations are conducted daily (and vigorously,
sometimes for weeks at a time) on the project's electronic forum,
blake-proj, supplemented by telephone, the annual Blake camps (see
above, <a href="" offset="55" scroll-to-element="history">History</a>),
and meetings in person as needed. Student assistants
collaborate closely with the editors who oversee their work. The proof
that this arrangement has worked well in moving the project along
swiftly and efficiently is manifest, we believe, in the record of
productivity to date. As we add new categories of Blake's work to the
Archive, we shall continue to require significant technical support
from CDLA.</p>

      <p>The Archive's first phase was defined by three goals: to
design and
construct the foundations of a searchable, SGML-encoded Archive; to
acquire major works, mostly illuminated books, from major collections
required for the basic structure of the Archive; and to place in the
Archive, fully marked up and publicly accessible free on the Web, at
least one copy of each illuminated book. We achieved the last of these
goals in 2003 with the publication of <i>Jerusalem</i>. In
our second phase,
we accomplished the subsequent goal of placing multiple copies of
illuminated books in the Archive whenever possible, with the focus on
those copies that represent different printings of each book. We
continued this expansion during the third phase. Since books printed in
the same session can differ significantly&#8212;with important
variants
in coloring, motifs, arrangements, etc.&#8212;we have included
multiple
copies of books from the same printing as well as those from different
printings. The public's exposure to Blake&#8212;including many
advanced
students and not a few scholars&#8212; has been narrowly restricted
to
a small number of items that have been too frequently reproduced, such
as <i>Songs of Innocence</i> copy B. We shall continue to
acquire and
incorporate copies never before reproduced or poorly
reproduced&#8212;a
category that unfortunately includes all but a very few of the
books&#8212;thereby making rare and unique material widely
accessible,
in many cases for the first time. By mid-2010 the Archive had published
electronic editions of 75 copies of Blake's 19 illuminated works.
(Explanatory updates for all publications are available; see <a href="https://www.blakearchive.org/public/all-updates.html" target="_blank">Blake
Archive Updates</a>.)</p>

      <p>But the preoccupations of our day-to-day work shifted in
the
second and
third phases to works in other categories: prints of various kinds,
drawings, paintings, manuscripts, and typographical works. We began
phase two with a large number of transparencies from these
categories&#8212;about 750 ready to be digitized, corrected, marked
up,
and placed in the Archive at an appropriate time. To this number, we
added over 2000 transparencies and digital images of illuminated and
non-illuminated works from nine collections, including 1263 from the
British Museum (the world's largest Blake collection), and the entire
Blake collections of the Fogg Art Museum: the Museum of Fine Arts,
Boston; the National Gallery of Art, Washington; the National Gallery
of Victoria; the Metropolitan Museum of Art; the Birmingham Museums and
Art Gallery; the Victoria and Albert Museum; and the Whitworth Art
Gallery&#8212;far more than we initially anticipated. At the end of
our
third phase, we had published 25 scholarly editions of non-illuminated
works representing each of the categories listed above. At the end of
phase three, we added approximately 400 more images of works from all
categories. We begin phase four with nearly 6000 images from 27
contributing collections&#8212;all the major Blake collections in
the
world. We hope to acquire another 500 or more images over the next five
years. Archive editions are published in the context of full
bibliographic information about each work, scrupulous diplomatic
transcriptions of all texts, detailed descriptions of all images, and
extensive bibliographies.</p>

      <p><strong>Phase four, 2009-13</strong>: Our
fourth phase of
development is defined by five
ambitious goals that bring us closer to the founding vision of the
Archive: </p>

      <p><strong>Goal 1</strong>: Design and
implement an entirely
redesigned user interface
enriched with superlatively useful and unprecedented features, such as
Related Works, by which a user can quickly identify and access other
works in the Archive related to the one under
consideration&#8212;finished water colors based on one preliminary
drawing, for example, or an unrevised draft for a printed
poem&#8212;and sophisticated, robust new digital tools, such as the
Virtual Lightbox.</p>

      <p>In 2009 the Archive added a new set of scholarly tools,
known
collectively as our Related Works system, that are designed to show
relationships among works and individual objects in the Archive. They
function at two levels. First, work index pages now include active
links to related materials in the Archive. So, for example, researchers
can move easily from any given series of illustrations to the Book of
Job to any other series. Second, the Show Me menu on object view pages
now includes "Related Works in the Archive." Like
the
work-level menu, this list includes active links to related designs and
is meant to allow study of the related materials side by side. For
example, researchers can move quickly from Blake's engraving
of
Behemoth and Leviathan to his drawing for it in the sketchbook and study how
Blake developed his design from preliminary sketch to finished
engraving. The first publication in the Archive to use this feature was
Blake's illustrations to Mary Wollstonecraft's <i>Original
Stories from
Real Life.</i></p>

      <p>The Lightbox, developed by Matthew Kirschenbaum in
collaboration with
the <a href="https://mith.umd.edu/" target="_blank">[University of] Maryland Institute for Technology in the
Humanities</a>, is an open-source browser application that will allow our
users, guided by the familiar "shopping cart" metaphor, to collect and
compare images from across the site at high resolution, manipulate them
for detailed study, and access image descriptions. The Lightbox will
replace Inote, our original image-annotating tool.</p>

      <p>The Lightbox allows users to zoom and crop images,
making it
easy to
study specific details and motifs. Users can arrange images simply by
dragging them around the workspace; this freedom encourages
juxtaposition and comparison. Furthermore, because users can send any
object in the Archive to the Lightbox, it is possible to collect items
from across genres, media, and time periods. Users may add objects
directly from object view pages or image search results, or they may
right-click any object in the Lightbox to call up a menu of other
objects in the Archive. In addition to zooming and cropping, several
other features make the Lightbox a powerful tool for studying objects
in the Archive. As on the object view page, users can display images at
true size, read image descriptions, and view metadata about the image
itself. Other toolbar buttons link to the object view page of any open
image, delete the currently selected image from the workspace, undo
previous actions, open help documentation, and tidy the workspace by
snapping images to a grid. These images are not merely displayed at
correct scale <i>relative</i> to one another; the Lightbox
detects the
user's screen resolution and, based on that information,
delivers
images at actual size.</p>

      <p>Although, with minor revisions, our present interface
has
served our
users well, a complete overhaul is past due, but is a daunting task. In
2007 we began the process by mounting on our testing site, for internal
review and comment, the draft prototype of a revised interface. Since
then we have refined our original ideas as we have continued to develop
tools and features that can offer users a heightened experience of the
Archive's ability to support advanced humanities research.</p>

      <p><strong>Goal 2</strong>: Move Blake's unique
manuscripts and
rare
typographical
works from early development into our normal production schedule until
we are in a position to publish scholarly editions of <i>The
Four Zoas</i> and
Blake's Notebook, two extremely significant, complex, and
fragile
manuscripts in the British Library.</p>

      <p>Text editing has always played a major role in the
Archive's
work, and a statement of the conservative,
"diplomatic" or
documentary, object-oriented principles that govern our practices was
among the first documents we published (see <a href="https://www.blakearchive.org/public/about/principles/index.html" target="_blank">Editorial
Principles</a>). We
recognized that our first undertaking, the texts of the illuminated
books&#8212;which Blake etched and printed for reproduction in
multiple
copies&#8212;would be an appropriate first step. Those mostly
straightforward texts present fewer editorial challenges than his
longest manuscripts, which have defied the best efforts of his most
resourceful and disciplined editors. We settled on a progressive
approach: we would venture out step by step from the textual rudiments
of the illuminated books through the increasingly steep terrain of
manuscripts arranged according to length, difficulty, and coherence
with our publishing program (see <a href="" offset="55" scroll-to-element="history">History</a>,
phases two and three).</p>

      <p>As we acquired images of visual art from major
international
Blake
collections, we simultaneously acquired images of his manuscript pages.
That process climaxed with our success in obtaining the British
Library's permission to publish its Blake
treasures&#8212;among
them <i>The Four Zoas</i>, a vast "prophetic" work central
to the
development of Blake's ideas, which he left in draft after a decade of
intensive artistic effort, and his working Notebook (with contributions
from his inspiring younger brother Robert, who died of tuberculosis in
1787), a rich trove of visual and literary artistic ideas highly
resistant to traditional scholarly editorial approaches. The British
Library granted rare access to the highly restricted and delicate <i>Four
Zoas</i> manuscript on site for several days and then supplied
impressive
new digital photography of all their Blake manuscripts. Their file
collection of <i>Zoas</i> photographs had deteriorated
badly; the new
reproductions will be the finest ever published.</p>

      <p>Textual
transcription is
far more complicated when
dealing
with manuscripts than with illuminated books. In 2006 the University of
Rochester Department of English agreed to sponsor an Archive team to
specialize in text editing. Grounded in the preliminary editorial work
by Archive editors and assistants on Blake's manuscript
satire <i>An
Island in the Moon</i> (Fitzwilliam Museum), the Rochester team
has
developed a sophisticated XML tagset tailored to the needs of
Blake's manuscripts and to the fundamental principles of the
Archive, plus a highly legible and simple color-coding system (using
XSLT and CSS) capable of displaying most of Blake's
manuscript
alterations and eliminating the clutter of conventional textual signs
and symbols. The Rochester group has further strengthened the
explanatory power of the editors' notes with zoomed images of
textual cruxes. </p>

      <p>This team is currently extending the <i>Island</i>
system to a
series
of Blake's most revealing letters, another large and
dispersed
set of unique documents, to be published in coherent groups. We are
also extending the testing to a second literary work, the so-called
Pickering Manuscript (Morgan Library), which includes some of
Blake's most mature lyric and narrative poems in fair copy.
Soon
after will follow such manuscript works as <i>Tiriel</i>,
with its extant
drawings, and Blake's marginalia (editorially difficult
because
they combine manuscript and print on the same physical support). As we
establish a strong track record of text editing, we will start work on
      <i>The Four Zoas</i>. The <i>Zoas</i>,
we know, will be hard and time-consuming. So
we will divide the text editing into two streams, one for the <i>Zoas</i>
and
the Notebook (which includes, for example, such key works as
"A
Vision of the Last Judgment," "Public
Address," and
"The Everlasting Gospel"), the other for a host of
smaller
but highly significant projects, including the few conventionally
printed works that Blake authored (principally <i>The French
Revolution</i>,
      <i>Poetical Sketches</i>, and the <i>Descriptive
Catalogue</i> for his one-man
exhibition of 1809).</p>

      <p>The Archive will continue to pursue its original mission
of
publishing exemplary copies from every printing of Blake's 19
illuminated works and completing the full production histories of as
many books as possible. We will also continue to add non-illuminated
works&#8212;engravings, drawings, water colors, paintings, and
color
prints&#8212;which typically have minimal texts but contain complex
images that can be extraordinarily hard to describe. Currently, most
non-illuminated works are published in preview mode, which makes them
available to scholars and students with all the features of the Archive
except for image search and Inote. But we have begun to republish these
works in full mode with searchable images, and to publish new
non-illuminated works in full mode, bypassing preview altogether. In
late 2009 we republished three series that were previously published
in preview mode: the Thomas Butts and John Linnell series of
Blake's water color illustrations to the Book of Job and the
sketchbook of preliminary pencil drawings for his Job engravings. In
the coming months, we will publish similarly updated versions of other
works presently in preview mode, including Blake's nine
series of
water colors illustrating the poetry of John Milton. Blake's
sketches and engravings for Mary Wollstonecraft's <i>Original
Stories from Real Life</i> have already been published in full
mode, and
several other new non-illuminated works&#8212;the manuscript of <i>An
Island in the Moon</i>, <i>A Small Book of Designs</i>
copy A, and <i>A Large Book of
Designs</i> copy A&#8212;are scheduled for publication in
full mode in
2010.</p>

      <p>Since the Archive's second phase, we have been
publishing
Blake's work in media other than illuminated printing and
altering the Archive's architecture and programming structure as
needed. <i>An Island in the Moon</i>, for instance, has
required a
transcription markup tagset specific to Blake's manuscript works. The
publication in preview mode of 20 water color drawings required the
creation of a <i>virtual group</i> protocol that allows
many individual works
to appear on the same dynamically generated table of contents even when
those works are not copies of the same illuminated book. Such
innovations balance the integrity of the Blakean
"work" and
individual "object" (the fundamental building
blocks of the
Archive) with the site's ease of use. <i>A Small Book of Designs</i>
has
inspired changes to the Archive's Compare feature, originally designed
for use with illuminated books but now modified to include works in
other media. And the recent publication of sketches and engravings for
Mary Wollstonecraft's <i>Original Stories from Real Life</i>
prompted the
implementation of our new Related Works feature.</p>

      <p><strong>Goal 3</strong>: Acquire
approximately 500 new images
over five years from 30 institutions (25 of which are contributing works for the first time) in line with the fundamental program of expansion that has
coordinated our efforts since we first articulated it during phase two.</p>

      <p>Our overarching aim is to incorporate, for the first
time, a
history of
Blake's artistic production into an edition capable of
representing the full range of his artistic achievement. Our starting
point, Blake's greatly admired, intensively studied, but
fragile
and widely dispersed series of illuminated books,
has
served as the archival and editorial backbone for the project. It
supports a twofold strategy: to evolve along lines that maximize both
the broad coverage of Blake's work, across multiple decades
and
various media, and deep scholarly coherence. We maintain coherence by
expanding the core with works that are closely related (historically,
thematically, physically) and by giving priority to significant
interrelated clusters (clustered by medium, such as the large color
prints of 1795, or by subject or theme, such as the Job and Milton
illustrations in several media). Whenever possible, we assemble these
individual clusters into larger ones. For instance, we are able to
represent Blake's work as a printmaker in several graphic
media
more coherently than previously possible by expanding outward from the
core of illuminated books (typically water colored relief etchings) to
the other works designed and engraved by Blake, and then to those
designed by him but engraved by others, and finally to those designed
by others but engraved by him. The Archive's Related Works
feature, which dynamically links works in different media across the
Archive, supports the twofold goal of broad coverage and scholarly
coherence: as we publish new acquisitions, Related Works will make
their relationship to core works clear, allowing students of Blake to
consider and compare works in different media in ways that have until
now been difficult if not impossible.</p>

      <p><strong>Goal 4</strong>: Describe and encode
all Archive
images to make image
searches&#8212;that is, deep searches on the actual subject-content
of
images at a very fine level of detail&#8212;function
across <i>all</i>
genres and media, making it possible for the first time to study
Blake's works through text- and image-searching tools that
harness the combined power of superbly detailed, accurate
reproductions; a unique keyword lexicon; meticulous image descriptions;
and innovative software.</p>

      <p>Blake scholars are intensely interested in the precise
composition and
the semantic content of his images, but searching for those details in
books and dispersed originals has been extremely difficult. Training
dedicated graduate students to deploy our keyword vocabulary has made
this work increasingly efficient; recruiting and retaining these
assistants is part of the Archive's long-term plan. Ongoing
improvements to the Archive's image-search capabilities
include
an expanding visual vocabulary and technical improvements such as
thesaurus-based searching.</p>

      <p><strong>Goal 5</strong>: Complete the work,
begun in 2009, of
incorporating <a href="https://www.rochester.edu/college/eng/" target="_blank"><i>Blake/An
Illustrated
Quarterly</i></a>
(1968-present)&#8212;for over four
decades the journal of record in Blake studies and the publisher of an
impressive body of articles and notes, bibliographies, discussions, and
reviews&#8212;to create an unprecedented synthesis in humanities
scholarship.</p>

      <p>This amplified Archive will be, we believe, the first
major
electronic
resource in the humanities to integrate a major scholarly journal. All
images ever printed in the quarterly (typically mediocre
black-and-white halftones) will be linked to their vastly superior
counterparts in the images of the Archive and, of course, to all the
tools, features, and information of the Archive (deep image and text
searches, for example). Conversely, all works in the Archive will be
linked to related publications in the quarterly. A researcher
interested in Blake's <i>Jerusalem</i> can access our
editions of
      <i>Jerusalem</i>, related works, and their
bibliographies, but also the
quarterly's <i>Jerusalem</i> scholarship, such as Aileen
Ward's
and V. A. De Luca's lucid essays on the complex history of
its
composition. An art historian tracing the fascinating history of the
recent discovery and subsequent sale at auction of 19 of
Blake's
water color designs for Blair's <i>The Grave</i> will have
access
(through the quarterly) to Robert Essick's annual accounts of
Blake sales, G. E. Bentley, Jr.'s annual checklists of
research,
and Martin Butlin and Robin Hamlyn's comprehensive
art-historical
account of the water colors&#8212;as well as to the
Archive's
meticulous editions of the water colors themselves. A user interested
in the methods by which Blake produced his stunning series of color
printed drawings of 1795 can examine the scholarly editions of those
drawings in the Archive while, in the quarterly, following the
unexpectedly fierce scholarly debate over Blake's
color-printing
methods, which would have been nearly impossible for Robert Essick and
Joseph Viscomi to document without their many enhanced enlargements of
details from Archive images. The "pages" of all
past issues
of the quarterly will appear in a streamlined, uniform electronic
format designed to integrate seamlessly with the rest of the Archive,
while archival PDFs of all the original printed pages of the journal
will also be available.</p>

      <p><strong>The Archive as scholarly resource</strong>:
Since its
inception, evidence of the
use of the Archive to sustain serious scholarship&#8212;our stated
objective&#8212;has continued to accumulate. For scholars,
publishers,
and others, the Archive has increasingly become a standard source of
images and transcriptions of Blake's works for republication. In his
multimedia essay "Golgonooza Text" (2005), Nelson
Hilton
calls the Archive "an indispensable resource without which
this
presentation&#8212;for one example&#8212;could not
exist" (par.
5). Thomas Pfau ties his discussion of <i>The [First] Book of Urizen</i>
to our
electronic edition of copy G in his book <i>Romantic Moods:
Paranoia,
Trauma, and Melancholy, 1790-1840</i> (2005). And the latest
Norton
Critical Edition of Blake's works (2008) uses the
Archive's
transcriptions of the illuminated works and reproduces images provided
by the Archive (see <a href="https://www.blakearchive.org/public/about/articles/index.html" target="_blank">Articles
about the Archive</a>).</p>

      <p>The Archive has created new opportunities for scholarly
discoveries.
Two definitive essays on Blake's "color printing"&#8212; Robert
Essick and Joseph Viscomi's "An Inquiry into Blake's Method
of
Color Printing" and "Blake's Method of Color Printing: Some Responses
and Further Observations," in <i>Blake/An Illustrated Quarterly</i>
(winter
2002 and fall 2002, respectively)&#8212;would have been
unimaginable
without the array of evidence from the Archive images. In the ensuing
debate about Blake's methods, Blake scholars Michael Phillips and
Martin Butlin responded to these findings in the fall 2002 issue of the
quarterly. The following year, Essick and Rosamund A. Paice announced,
in the spring 2003 quarterly, nine previously unknown drawings
discovered in the British Museum by the Archive editors when they
photographed its collection. The number of articles on the Archive
project itself continues to increase (see <a href="https://www.blakearchive.org/public/about/articles/index.html" target="_blank">Articles
about the Archive</a>).</p>

      <p>The Archive's technical significance is signaled by the
first
dissertation inspired by the Archive, Vladimir Misic's "Mixed Raster
Content for Processing of Colored Engravings" (Department of Electrical
and Computer Engineering, University of Rochester, 2003). The
dissertation involved active collaboration with Xerox Corporation. Rob
Buckley of Xerox presented a paper on the subject, "Document Imaging on
the Web with MRC [Multi-Raster Content, a Xerox technology] and JPEG
2000," at the invitation-only EVA (Electronic Imaging and the Visual
Arts) Harvard Symposium, October 2-3, 2002.</p>

      <p>The Archive has also achieved recognition for its status
as an
online
humanities archive and a scholarly edition. <a href="https://edsitement.neh.gov/" target="_blank">EDSITEment</a>&#8212;which,
under the auspices of the NEH and
affiliated organizations, assesses and compiles online humanities
resources&#8212;has named the Archive one of the "Best of the
Humanities on the Web" in its Literature and Language Arts category.
The Archive was also selected as "a groundbreaking hypermedia project"
in the humanities by the <a href="https://www.cbi.umn.edu/" target="_blank">Charles
Babbage
Institute</a>, the foremost
archive for scholarly internet sites, which has acquired the Archive's
early project records (1995-2002) for future study by scholars
interested in the history of information technology. When the Archive
received the 2003 Prize for a Distinguished Scholarly Edition by the
Modern Language Association, the selection committee's citation
affirmed that "the William Blake Archive has set a high mark for future
editorial practice through its clarity, user-friendliness, beauty, and
erudition." In 2005, the Archive became the first electronic
scholarly edition to receive the Approved Edition seal from the Modern
Language Association's Committee on Scholarly Editions.</p>

full resources of the
Archive are available to all
who can
access it via the World Wide Web. We are committed to the continued
development and maintenance of a free site, for reasons we have
outlined above. From the start we have encouraged feedback from users
via an e-mail link (we routinely respond to inquiries and comments). By
filling out a form at the site itself, users can also subscribe to
Blake Archive Updates and automatically receive e-mail notices with the
latest information. These notices are regularly posted to several
online discussion groups as well.</p>

      <p>One of the foremost advantages of electronic publication
is
the ability
of the medium to accommodate growth and change. In one sense, then, a
final product and date of publication never arrive, at least not as
they do in the world of print. That said, the Archive has expanded very
nearly to its full intended shape. The intricate XML architecture and
stylesheets required to integrate and display the full range of Blake's
works in all media have been developed, and the Archive contains
objects from each category of Blake's works.</p>

      <p>Since moving to the University of North Carolina, we
have
increased the
number of publications per year from four to eight, which we will
continue over the next five years. Beyond the Archive itself, we
disseminate our findings in lectures, conferences, and published
reports (see <a href="https://www.blakearchive.org/public/presentations.html" target="_blank">Presentations
and Demonstrations about the Archive</a>).
The
Archive is a frequent subject in discussions of humanities computing,
editorial theory and method, and the future of scholarly communication.
We increase our outreach through participation in discipline-based
organizations, such as the MLA's Committee on Scholarly
Editions,
and in initiatives such as <a href="https://www.nines.org/" target="_blank">NINES</a>.</p>

      <p>Because the Blake Archive has become a central scholarly
resource, we
have recognized our role as a liaison among scholars, institutions, and
private collectors. Scholars needing the best reproductions and texts
for their own published research now come to us frequently, and, in
cooperation with our contributing collections, we supply their needs
whenever possible. Incorporating the journal of record in Blake
studies, <a href="https://www.rochester.edu/college/eng/" target="_blank"><i>Blake/An
Illustrated
Quarterly</i></a>,
into the Archive in the near
future will further strengthen the circuit of scholarly communication
in our field. Altogether, this augmented William Blake Archive aims to
realize our original vision by setting a new standard of accessibility
to a vast array of visual and textual materials that are central to a
thorough grasp of the art and literature of the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries.</p>
