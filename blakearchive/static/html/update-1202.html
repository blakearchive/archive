      <p>18 December 2002</p>
      
      
      <p>The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of
        Blake's 22 engraved <i>Illustrations of the Book of Job</i>. This work is
        generally considered Blake's masterpiece in traditional line engraving, as
        well as the culmination of his long pictorial engagement with the Book of
        Job. His first series of 19 water colors illustrating Job were commissioned
        c. 1805-06 by his chief patron, Thomas Butts. These are available in the
        Archive in Preview (see description below). In 1821, Blake and his new patron
        John Linnell borrowed this Butts set of designs. Linnell traced the series
        and Blake colored them. Blake also added two more compositions to this later
        group and added versions of these same compositions to the earlier series, so
        that both sets now have 21 designs. The Linnell set led directly to his
        commissioning of the engravings, as set forth in a contract dated 25 March
        1823. Blake began the project by executing a series of 21 reduced pencil
        sketches of the central designs for transfer to the copperplates. According
        to John Linnell, the border designs, unique to the engraved series, were a
        last-minute addition. Blake also added a title page, perhaps late in the
        production process. Although 21 of the plates bear 1825 imprints (the second
        plate was mistakenly dated 1828), Linnell's account books show that the
        engravings were not published until March 1826.</p>
      
      
      <p>The copy reproduced in the Archive is from the first printing on laid
        India paper with the word Proof appearing lower right on all but the title
        page. Also included, as the first item, is a copy of the original letterpress
        cover label for the Job engravings. Our complete transcription of all
        engraved texts on each plate is the first to be published in any form. Both
        these inscribed texts and the designs are fully searchable.</p>
      
      
      <p>At present the Archive contains 48 copies of 18 of Blake's 19 illuminated
        books, all fully searchable. In addition to the Butts set of Job designs,
        Blake's illustrations to Milton's "L'Allegro" and "Il Penseroso" are also
        available in Preview, our mode of presentation that provides all the features
        of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (our image annotation program).
        In the near future we expect to release a much-anticipated electronic edition
        of <i>Jerusalem</i> copy E, and further supplementary materials, including a
        biography and glossary and more drawings and prints in Preview, including the
        Job pencil sketches noted above.</p>
      
      
      <p>As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access
        restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible
        through the continuing support of the Institute for Advanced Technology in
        the Humanities at the University of Virginia, by a major grant from the
        Preservation and Access Division of the National Endowment for the
        Humanities, by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and by the
        cooperation of the international array of libraries and museums that have
        generously given us permission to reproduce works from their collections in
        the Archive.</p>
