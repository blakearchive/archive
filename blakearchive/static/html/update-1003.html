      <p>31 October 2003</p>
      
      
      <p>The William Blake Archive <!--<www.blakearchive.org>--> is pleased to
        announce the publication of the electronic edition of <i>The First Book of
          Urizen</i> copy B. One of eight extant copies--and one of two with all 28
        plates--copy B was acquired by the portrait painter George Romney, probably
        directly from Blake. Now in the Pierpont Morgan Library, it joins copies A,
        C, F, and G in the Archive and will be joined by copy D in the near future.
        The plate order for each of these copies is unique.</p>
      
      
      <p><i>Urizen</i> is dated 1794 on its title plate, and the first six copies
        were color printed that year. Copy B was printed the following year and at
        first sight appears to have been color printed, but it was printed in one ink
        with watercolor washes and opaque colors applied in simulation of color
        printing. It was printed on large sheets of paper primarily in a light black
        ink, with hues of green and brown, as part of a deluxe set of illuminated
        books printed in the same format. Other books in the Archive from this set
        are <i>All Religions are One</i> copy A and <i>There is No Natural
          Religion</i> copy L; <i>The Book of Thel</i> copy F; <i>The Marriage of
            Heaven and Hell</i> copy D; <i>Visions of the Daughters of Albion</i> copy G;
        <i>America a Prophecy</i> copies A and B; <i>Songs of Innocence and of
          Experience</i> copy R.</p>
      
      
      <p>As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access
        restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible
        through the continuing support of the Library of Congress, the Institute for
        Advanced Technology in the Humanities at the University of Virginia, by a
        major grant from the Preservation and Access Division of the National
        Endowment for the Humanities, by the University of North Carolina at Chapel
        Hill, and by the cooperation of the international array of libraries and
        museums that have generously given us permission to reproduce works from
        their collections in the Archive.</p>
