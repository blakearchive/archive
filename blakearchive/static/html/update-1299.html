      <!--<h2 class="title">William Blake Archive Update</h2>-->
      <p>
      <p>14 December 1999</p>
      
      
      <p>The William Blake Archive https://www.blakearchive.org is pleased to
        announce the publication of new electronic editions of <cite>The Songs of
          Innocence and of Experience</cite> copies R and AA. Copy AA has been
        reproduced only once previously, as a microfilm many years ago; copy R has
        never been reproduced before.</p>
      
      
      <p><cite>Songs</cite> copies R and AA are both in the Fitzwilliam Museum,
        Cambridge, England. They join copies of <cite>Songs</cite> in the Archive
        from other printings: copies C (1789/1794), F (1789/1794), L (1795), and Z
        (1826). Copies O and V, from 1795 and c. 1818 printings, are forthcoming.</p>
      
      
      <p>The electronic editions have newly edited SGML-encoded texts and new
        images scanned and color-corrected from first-generation 4x5" transparencies;
        text and images are each fully searchable and supported by the Inote and
        ImageSizer applications described in our previous updates.</p>
      
      
      <p>With the publication of these two titles, the Archive now contains 39
        copies of 18 separate books, including at least one copy of every one of
        Blake's works in illuminated printing except the 100 plates of
        <cite>Jerusalem</cite> (forthcoming).</p>
      
      
      <p>We are also pleased to announce that the Archive was recently named to the
        NEH's prestigious EDSITEment list of "Top Humanities Web Sites"
        https://edsitement.neh.gov/.</p>
      
      
      <p>Copy R, printed and colored c. 1795, is of special interest because it was
        Blake's own copy and, with slight variations, provided the plate order for
        the last seven copies, printed between 1818 and 1827. This was the first time
        that Blake printed the <cite>Innocence</cite> and <cite>Experience</cite>
        plates in the same session. All copies of <cite>Songs</cite> produced before
        copy R--for example, copies C and F in the Archive--were compiled from
        <cite>Innocence</cite> impressions printed in 1789 (either from the raw
        sienna issue, as in copy C, or green issue, as in copy F) and
        <cite>Experience</cite> impressions printed in 1794 (either lightly color
        printed, as in copy C, or heavily color printed while <cite>Experience</cite>
        was still in progress, as in copy F). And copy R marks the first time that
        Blake printed plates 34-36 ("The Little Girl Lost" and "The Little Girl
        Found") as <cite>Experience</cite> plates; in the earlier copies of
        <cite>Songs</cite> he printed them as <cite>Innocence</cite> poems and
        transferred them to <cite>Experience</cite> at the time of compilation.</p>
      
      
      <p>Though Blake printed the <cite>Innocence</cite> and
        <cite>Experience</cite> plates in the same session, he apparently meant for
        them to be separate works. He printed the plates in various shades of
        greenish and grayish black ink, but did not print the combined title plate,
        and stabbed and numbered the two parts as separate volumes. He produced copy
        R, in other words, almost exactly as he advertised its two separate sections
        in his prospectus of October 1793, where <cite>Songs of Innocence and of
          Experience</cite> was not advertised as such, but rather as "Songs of
        Innocence" and "Songs of Experience," with each part listed as a separate
        work and described as "Octavo, with 25 designs, price 5s." Almost exactly,
        but not quite, because copy R was printed on one side of folio-size leaves
        and its <cite>Experience</cite> had only twenty-four designs, since it did
        not include "To Tirzah," which had not yet been executed, or plate a, which
        had been used as a tailpiece in copies B-D.</p>
      
      
      <p><cite>Songs</cite> copy R now has the combined title plate and "To
        Tirzah," but both were inserted late. "To Tirzah" may have been printed and
        inserted with the copy's impression of "The Tyger," which is watermarked "J
        Whatman / 1808" (the only impression so marked). Both plates were printed in
        a solid black ink, not the greenish and grayish black of the other plates,
        and are numbered sequentially as part of <cite>Experience</cite> (1-25) and
        thus must have been inserted before this numbering and the numbering, in the
        same style and medium, of <cite>Innocence</cite> (1-28). The combined title
        plate was also printed in this solid black ink, but it is unnumbered and may
        have been printed and/or added later, though almost certainly before copy R
        was sold to Linnell in 1819, by which time the pages had been given four
        framelines, the <cite>Experience</cite> pages had been renumbered 29-53 to
        continue the sequence of numbers in <cite>Innocence</cite>, and many
        <cite>Experience</cite> impressions had been recolored.</p>
      
      
      <p>Copy R was produced with <cite>Songs</cite> copy A as part of a set of
        illuminated books printed on large paper, approximately 38 x 27 cm., the size
        of the "I Taylor" paper it shares with copy A. It was trimmed to 30 x 22 cm.
        when bound to match Linnell's other illuminated books. Copy R joins other
        works from the large-paper set now in the Archive (<cite>The Book of
          Thel</cite> copy F, <cite>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</cite> copy D,
        <cite>There is No Natural Religion</cite> copy L, <cite>All Religions are
          One</cite> copy A, and <cite>America, a Prophecy</cite> copy A, and
        <cite>Visions of the Daughters of Albion</cite> copy G) and forthcoming
        (<cite>The First Book of Urizen</cite> copy B and <cite>Europe, a
          Prophecy</cite> copy H).</p>
      
      
      <p><cite>Innocence</cite> and <cite>Experience</cite> were printed together
        as a single, combined work in 1826 to form <cite>Songs</cite> copy Z, which
        is in the Archive, and copy AA. Both copies sold for L5.5s., half what Blake
        listed <cite>Songs</cite> for in an 1827 letter. Both copies Z and AA were
        printed in the same orange ink Blake used ca. 1818 and 1821-22 (works from
        these sessions include <cite>The Book of Thel</cite> copy O, which is in the
        Archive, and <cite>Jerusalem</cite> copy E, <cite>America, a Prophecy</cite>
        copy O, <cite>Europe, a Prophecy</cite> copy K, <cite>Visions of the
          Daughters of Albion</cite> copy P, and <cite>The Marriage of Heaven and
            Hell</cite> copy G, each of which will enter the Archive within the next
        year). Like the books produced in these sessions, both copies were given
        single red framelines, though the pen and ink page numbers (1-54) were placed
        outside rather than inside the frameline.</p>
      
      
      <p>In the future, with the release of our revised site interface, users will
        be able to instantly compare impressions from various copies of an
        illuminated book within the same browser window. At the moment, users need to
        open other browser windows to make such comparisons. Doing so with
        impressions from copies AA and Z, however, is instructive and well worth the
        effort. Impressions from the same plate, though printed and colored in the
        same style, often appear quite different if the text was rewritten or an
        image was strengthened in pen and ink (either black or red). But this
        characteristically Blakean bounding line was usually necessitated by an
        otherwise illegible text or undifferentiated images. Overall, the impressions
        in copy AA were better printed and required less pen and ink salvaging than
        those used to form copy Z.</p>
