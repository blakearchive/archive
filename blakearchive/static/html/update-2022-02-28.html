 The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of a digital edition of the manuscript of 
               <a href="work/bb208">Blake's autograph (dated 16 January 1826) in the album of William Upcott</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
                Upcott (1779-1845) was the illegitimate son of Blake's friend and patron the miniaturist Ozias Humphry (1742-1810), who bequeathed to Upcott a number of Blake's works. 
                Upcott was a bookseller, librarian, bibliographer, editor, and inveterate collector, but he was perhaps best known for what he called his "autographic mania" (qtd. in Freeman, "Upcott, William (1779–1845)," <i>ODNB</i> [http://www.oxforddnb.com, accessed 18 Jan 2014]), which he exercised in his "autograph cottage" in Islington—where he was living when Blake left his autograph in Upcott's album either during a visit just a few months before Blake died, or, more probably, off the premises as the album circulated among the authors and artists whose signatures Upcott sought to acquire.
                The album may have been at Samuel Leigh's bookshop in the Strand, where Blake (and others) may have signed it: "On 16 Jan. 1826 he inscribed William Upcott's autograph album ‘by the desire of Mr Leigh'" (Bentley, <i>Records</i>, 369n).

                Upcott seems to have been a colorful character who earned the title Emperor of Autographs—he owned at least 40,000 according to his obituary. 
                And he owned illuminated works that his father bought directly from Blake: 
                <a href="work/songsie"><i>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</i></a> Copy H (containing only <i>Experience</i>), 
                <a href="work/america"><i>America a Prophecy</i></a> Copy H, 
                <a href="work/europe"><i>Europe a Prophecy</i></a> Copy D, 
                <a href="work/bb136"><i>A Small Book of Designs</i></a> Copy A, 
                and <a href="work/bb85"><i>A Large Book of Designs</i></a>.  
                Upcott's copy of <i>Europe</i> and both books of <i>Designs</i> are in the Archive.
               </p>

                Blake, perhaps "very much delighted with being in good Company" (Object 1, lines 1-2), inscribed a striking, elaborate signature with a characteristically Blakean note "Writ helter skelter like a hog upon a rope" (Object 1, lines 10-11) incorporating an equally characteristic sketch of a floating male, nude, with arms outstretched.  
                Blake's signature appears just under that of the painter Benjamin Haydon.
