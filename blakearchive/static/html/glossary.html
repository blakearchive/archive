      <p xmlns:js="javascript:code"><b>By Alexander S. Gourlay</b></p>
      <p xmlns:js="javascript:code">The following is a revised and expanded version of "A Glossary of Terms, Names, and Concepts in Blake" in <i>The Cambridge Companion to William Blake</i>, ed. Morris Eaves (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003), pages 272-87.  This resource is best used when Blake is
         making you dizzy, but as soon
         as you regain your equilibrium, you should return to reading Blake on his
         own terms.  Blake's names are particularly likely to inspire vertigo, but
         if he wanted us to depend heavily on glossaries, dictionaries, and other learned
         devices he would have provided them.  That he did not suggests that he wanted
         his readers to trust him and trust themselves rather than "experts," though
         he seems to have overestimated how well most us would know the Bible and the
         other traditions to which he alludes.  Many of his characters correspond roughly
         to more familiar beings from various mythologies, but by renaming them Blake
         indicated that we should start afresh with them as characters, before someone
         has told us what they mean.  At the same time, most of his characters are
         multivalent allegorical beings corresponding simultaneously to such things
         as mental faculties, emotions, psychological categories, political figures
         or positions, geographical entities, body parts and so forth.  Don't ignore
         the various polyglot etymologies that have been proposed for their names elsewhere,
         for these often appear to contribute to Blake's own conception of characters,
         though most names are primarily puns in English with echoes of familiar mythic
         names.  Bear in mind that Blake's characters may change in radical fashion,
         especially when separated from their emanations, and characters from one context
         may be presented from a very different perspective elsewhere, even in the
         same work, and may be known by several different names; these complexities
         are greatly oversimplified here.

      </p><b id=""></b><dl xmlns:js="javascript:code"><b id="g1"></b><p><b>Abel:</b>  Abel is the second child of Adam and Eve,
            murdered by his brother <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g18" offset="55">Cain</a> in Genesis 4.  Blake referred to the voice calling for vengeance in 4:10 as the <i>Ghost of Abel,</i> a phrase he used as the title
            of a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.blakearchive.org/work/abel">late etched work</a> (1822) inspired by Byron's <i>Cain</i> and
            Gessner's <i>Death of Abel</i>.  Elsewhere Blake treated
            this incident as the origin of the law of retribution rather than forgiveness.
         </p><b id="g2"></b><p><b>Adona: </b> Adona is the name of a river in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.blakearchive.org/work/thel"><i>The Book of Thel</i></a>; it appears
            to be a feminized version of "Adonis," who in classical myth is a beautiful youth with whom Venus
            was smitten, as told in Ovid, <i>Metamorphoses</i> 10; she
            mourns his early death, then transforms him into the short-lived windflower,
            the anemone, the species of flower shown on the title page of <i>Thel</i>.
         </p><b id="g3"></b><p><b>Ahania: </b> Ahania is an emanation of Urizen.  Her
            name suggests Urania, the muse associated with astronomy and the heavens (and
            an epithet of celestial Venus), and also the surprised laughter of discovery:
            "Aha!"  She is associated with pleasure (Urizen calls her "sin") and also
            charity, and her twelve sons correspond to the signs of the zodiac.
         </p><b id="g4"></b><p><b>Albion: </b> Albion is a traditional name for England
            and also a mythical English giant.  In Blake, the giant Albion is the country
            and its inhabitants, but is also identified as the fallen personification of
            all humankind, the Eternal Man.  <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g64" offset="55">Jerusalem</a> is his emanation and his Daughters
            are the women of England.
         </p><b id="g5"></b><p><b>Albion's Angel: </b> Albion's Angel is Blake's designation
            in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.blakearchive.org/work/america"><i>America</i></a> for the British politician (someone like
            Lord Bute), who debates the thirteen colonial angels, represented by Boston's
            Angel (someone like Samuel Adams).
         </p><b id="g6"></b><p><b>Ariston: </b> Called the "king of beauty" in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.blakearchive.org/work/america"><i>America</i></a>, Ariston also appears briefly in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.blakearchive.org/work/s-los"><i>The
               Song of Los</i></a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.blakearchive.org/work/bb209"><i>The Four Zoas</i></a>.  The name,
            which is related to a Greek root meaning "best," may have come from Herodotus.
         </p><b id="g7"></b><p><b>Ark: </b> Arks are vessels that preserve the divine
            against the dangers of the fallen world, such as Noah's ark and that in which
            Moses was found among the bulrushes.  The Ark of the Covenant (an elaborate
            chest wrought by the artists Bezaleel and Aholiab) held Moses' broken tablets
            of the Law, Aaron's rod, and a pot of manna; it was kept in the innermost
            sanctuary of a tabernacle (see <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g129" offset="55">veil</a>).  Blake's uses
            of arks reflect several interpretive traditions.
         </p><b id="g8"></b><p><b>Augury: </b> Roman augurers made prophecies by observing
            birds in flight; an augury can be any kind of divination, usually based upon
            signs in nature.
         </p><b id="g9"></b><p><b>Ball: </b>  See <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g50" offset="55">globe</a>.
         </p><b id="g10"></b><p><b>Bard: </b>  Bards were ancient prophets and poets
            of Britain, often associated in Blake's day with the Druids and with native
            opposition to invading <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g53" offset="55">Romans</a> or Normans, as in Thomas Gray's <i>The
               Bard</i> (1757).  The Bard of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.blakearchive.org/copy/songsie.c?descId=songsie.c.illbk.24"><i>Songs of Experience</i></a> has
            a presiding role paralleling that of the Shepherd in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.blakearchive.org/copy/songsie.c?descId=songsie.c.illbk.06"><i>Songs of Innocence</i></a>.
         </p><b id="g11"></b><p><b>Behmen: </b>  See <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g14" offset="55">Boehme</a>.
         </p><b id="g12"></b><p><b>Beulah: </b> Beulah ("married") is the happy country
            with which the Lord is delighted, according to Isaiah 62.  Blake's Beulah
            land is a dreamy paradise in which the sexes, though divided, blissfully converse
            in shameless selflessness.  Beulah is available through dreams and visions
            to those in Ulro, the utterly fallen world.
         </p><b id="g13"></b><p><b>Bird/Birds: </b> Like his references to <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g44" offset="55">flowers</a>, Blake's representations of birds often draw upon myth and folklore as well as behavioral characteristics of particular species.
            See for instance <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g28" offset="55">Dove</a> and <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g66" offset="55">Lark</a>.
         </p><b id="g14"></b><p><b>Boehme: </b>  Jacob Boehme or Behmen (1575-1624) was
            an engaging mystical philosopher whose works, as translated into English by
            William Law, profoundly influenced Blake's thinking throughout his career.
            Like <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g115" offset="55">Swedenborg</a>, Boehme interpreted the Bible in a radical spirit.
         </p><b id="g15"></b><p><b>Boston's Angel: </b>  See<a href="" scroll-to-element="#g5" offset="55"> Albion's
               Angel</a>.
         </p><b id="g16"></b><p><b>Bromion: </b> Bromion evokes "Bromius," an epithet
            for the Greek god Dionysus meaning "roarer." As a character in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.blakearchive.org/work/vda"><i>Visions
               of the Daughters of Albion</i></a>, he sometimes acts like another roaring
            rapist, Boreas, the North Wind, as in Ovid, <i>Metamorphoses</i> 6.
            See also <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g92" offset="55">Palamabron</a>.
         </p><b id="g17"></b><p><b>Butterfly/moth: </b>  Moths and butterflies were both
            called "flies" in the eighteenth century, and are treated very similarly (but
            distinguishably) by Blake, who followed the classical tradition of associating
            moths and butterflies with the soul.  See also <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g136" offset="55">worm</a>.
         </p><b id="g18"></b><p><b>Cain: </b> Cain, the first murderer, causes the initiation
            of the law of retribution that is supplanted by Jesus' law of forgiveness. See <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g1" offset="55">Abel</a>.
         </p><b id="g19"></b><p><b>Cart: </b>  A cart that accompanies a <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g94" offset="55">plow</a> carries
            dung as fertilizer.
         </p><b id="g20"></b><p><b>Chafer: </b>  The cockchafer is a large beetle that
            navigates by light, and thus tends to fly into lamps at night.  Its larval
            stage is spent underground.
         </p><b id="g21"></b><p><b>Classes: </b>  Milton's Puritan theology distinguishes
            between the Elect, saints for whom salvation is guaranteed; the Redeemed,
            those saved by Jesus Christ; and Reprobates or Transgressors, who are damned.
            In Blake's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.blakearchive.org/work/milton"><i>Milton</i></a> Jesus is a Transgressor who challenges
            the stuffy Elect.
         </p><b id="g22"></b><p><b>Contrary: </b>  Contraries are mirroring entities
            or principles that are mutually essential to each other though in apparent
            opposition: justice and mercy, innocence and experience, etc.  See also <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g84" offset="55">negation</a>.
         </p><b id="g23"></b><p><b>Converse/conversation: </b>  Like most people in his
            day, Blake used the word "conversation" to include all kinds of interactions,
            especially intimate ones, between individuals.  In law, "criminal conversation"
            was adultery, but in Blake the word is always positive in connotation.
         </p><b id="g24"></b><p><b>Covering Cherub: </b>: Blake's term for dangerous
            false versions of the divine, especially those calling for human sacrifice.
         </p><b id="g25"></b><p><b>Devil: </b>  Blake's Devil is a satirical foil who
            argues against conventional piety in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.blakearchive.org/work/mhh"><i>The Marriage of Heaven
               and Hell</i></a>; he is not the same as <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g103" offset="55">Satan</a>.
         </p><b id="g26"></b><p><b>Dinah: </b> Dinah is a form of <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g37" offset="55">Erin</a>.  In Genesis 30-34
            Dinah is the daughter of Jacob and Leah; her rape or seduction is deceitfully
            and brutally avenged by her brothers.
         </p><b id="g27"></b><p><b>Divided Man: </b>  When fallen, Man is divided into
            the humanity, the <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g33" offset="55">emanation</a>, the <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g109" offset="55">shadow</a>, and the <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g112" offset="55">spectre</a>.
         </p><b id="g28"></b><p><b>Dove/Pigeon: </b>  Doves and pigeons are notable among
            birds in that (unlike robins) they are happy to inhabit shelters that
            humans build for them.
         </p><b id="g29"></b><p><b>Druid: </b>  Druidism, the religion of pre-Christian
            Britain, featured nature-worship and human sacrifice, but also had a place
            for Bards.  Blake regarded Druidism as a universal proto-religion.
         </p><b id="g30"></b><p><b>Eden: </b>  Eden is a state of mind as well as a place.
         </p><b id="g31"></b><p><b>Edom: </b>  The arrival of the "dominion of Edom"
            in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.blakearchive.org/work/mhh"><i>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</i></a> suggests that
            hairy, primitive Esau ("Edom") will reclaim his birthright as the elder son,
            of which he was defrauded by his smoother twin Jacob ("Israel"); see Genesis
            27.
         </p><b id="g32"></b><p><b>Elect: </b>  See <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g21" offset="55">classes</a>.
         </p><b id="g33"></b><p><b>Emanation: </b>  An emanation is a feminine counterpart
            that has separated from an integrated masculine entity, as when Eve was created
            out of Adam and given a will and consciousness of her own.  But this separation
            is itself a stage or an aspect of a fall, as it leads to conflict between
            the formerly undivided aspects.  Many of Blake's female characters have emanated
            from male characters, and their relationships often resemble that between
            Adam and Eve.  In <a target="_blank" href="https://www.blakearchive.org/work/jerusalem"><i>Jerusalem</i></a>, where the concept of
            emanations is developed most fully, both male and female emanations exist
            even within the integrated beings in eternity.  See also <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g112" offset="55">spectre/spectrous</a>, <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g109" offset="55">shadow</a>, <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g27" offset="55">divided man</a>.
         </p><b id="g34"></b><p><b>Enitharmon: </b> Enitharmon is the beautiful emanation
            of <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g70" offset="55">Los</a>, the Poet, and her name is probably intended to suggest "Harmony" and
            a combination of <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g116" offset="55">Tharmas</a> and <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g35" offset="55">Enion</a>.  In <a target="_blank" href="https://www.blakearchive.org/work/europe"><i>Europe</i></a> Enitharmon
            is the church, offering a religion of chastity, guilt, and retribution that
            lasts eighteen hundred years.
         </p><b id="g35"></b><p><b>Enion: </b> As the emanation of <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g116" offset="55">Tharmas</a>, the body,
            Enion personifies bodily or maternal impulses.  See also <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g34" offset="55">Enitharmon</a>.
         </p><b id="g36"></b><p><b>Eno: </b> Eno, an anagram of "eon," is an "ancient
            mother" who represents the seven thousand years of human history in the fallen
            world.  See also <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g37" offset="55">Erin</a>.
         </p><b id="g37"></b><p><b>Erin: </b> Erin is Ireland.  Her forms include the
            maiden harp, a traditional symbol of Ireland and its arts (a harp incorporating the
            form of a woman/fish/bird), the rape victim Dinah of Genesis 30-34, and the
            "old woman," or Shan van vocht, traditional personification of Ireland in
            tribulation.
         </p><b id="g38"></b><p><b>Eternal Great Humanity Divine: </b> The Eternal Great
            Humanity Divine is Jesus as perceived by the <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g61" offset="55">imagination</a>, all humanity in
            one man.
         </p><b id="g39"></b><p><b>Eternals: </b>  See <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g47" offset="55">Four Zoas</a>.
         </p><b id="g40"></b><p><b>Eternity: </b> For Blake (and Milton), eternity was
            not simply an infinite amount of time but rather the absence of sequential
            time&#8212;from an eternal perspective, all events are simultaneous and all space
            is the same place.  The vertigo that one experiences when reading Blake's
            prophecies subsides when one recognizes that they offer something like an
            eternal perspective.
         </p><b id="g41"></b><p><b>Experience: </b>  See <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g62" offset="55">innocence
               and experience</a>.
         </p><b id="g42"></b><p><b>Female Will: </b>  See <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g135" offset="55">will</a>.
         </p><b id="g43"></b><p><b>Fiber: </b>  Blake knew that nerve cells were fibers,
            and because the sensations of the body are conducted by fibers, bodily existence
            has an essentially fibrous quality.  See also <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g133" offset="55">weave/weaving/woven</a>, <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g129" offset="55">veil</a>, <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g127" offset="55">Vala</a>.
         </p><b id="g44"></b><p><b>Flowers: </b> Flowers in Blake represent transient
            beauty and femininity, especially the female genitalia, but one should also
            pay attention to the species of each flower he mentions or depicts, since
            many of his flower images draw upon myths, folklore, poetic conventions, and/or
            the humanized botanical narratives in Erasmus Darwin's <i>The Botanic Garden</i> (1789-91).  See <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g13" offset="55">Birds</a>.
         </p><b id="g45"></b><p><b>Fly: </b>  See <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g17" offset="55">butterfly/moth</a>.
         </p><b id="g46"></b><p><b>Four/fourfold: </b>  Blake adapted the mystical habit
            of thinking in terms of sets of four that correspond to compass points, seasons,
            humors, bodily organs, and so forth.
         </p><b id="g47"></b><p><b>Four Zoas: </b>  Revelation 4 describes four "zoa,"
            Greek for living creatures or beasts; Blake appropriated the term for his
            fourfold division of the aspects of humanity.  The four are <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g70" offset="55">Los</a>/<a href="" scroll-to-element="#g126" offset="55">Urthona</a> (imagination),
            <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g125" offset="55">Urizen</a> (intellect), <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g71" offset="55">Luvah</a>/<a href="" scroll-to-element="#g90" offset="55">Orc</a> (passion), and <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g116" offset="55">Tharmas</a> (instinct).
         </p><b id="g48"></b><p><b>Generation: </b> Generation is the cycle of birth
            and death through which living things survive in the fallen world.
         </p><b id="g49"></b><p><b>Genius: </b> Genius once meant a personifying or epitomizing
            spiritual being rather than a brilliant person.  See <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g95" offset="55">Poetic
               Genius</a>.
         </p><b id="g50"></b><p><b>Globe: </b> Objects such as the earth or the human
            heart, viewed from ordinary (fallen) perspectives, appear to be globes, folded
            in on themselves rather than infinite.  See also <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g131" offset="55">vortex</a>.
         </p><b id="g51"></b><p><b>Gold: </b> As a literal metallic substance, especially as coins, gold is usually represented by Blake as one of the roots of evil, but
            he used "shell gold" and gold leaf in his art and in general goldenness is a positive attribute when not in the form of guineas.
         </p><b id="g52"></b><p><b>Golgonooza: </b> Golgonooza is a city representing
            the human body as seen by the <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g61" offset="55">imagination</a>.
         </p><b id="g53"></b><p><b>Greeks/Romans: </b> Blake admired the work of many individual Greek and Roman authors, especially Ovid, and, though he suggested that much of
            it was copied from older originals, Greek and Roman art.  But he saw Greek and Roman culture as a whole as being poisoned
            by militarism, materialism, slavery and sexual aggression.
         </p><b id="g54"></b><p><b>Har: </b>  In two early poems, Har and Heva are an
            aged Adam and Eve in a (neo)classical garden world; in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.blakearchive.org/work/thel"><i>The
               Book of Thel</i>,/, the vales of Har seem to be a special version of Arcadia,
            traditionally a land of pastoral simplicity populated by amorous idle shepherds.
         </p><b id="g55"></b><p><b>Harrow: </b>  In agriculture, the harrow breaks up
            the earth turned over by the plow.  The harrow is the tool of <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g92" offset="55">Palamabron</a>.
            The roller follows the harrow.

            and shallow poet who patronized Blake, setting him up in a cottage at Hayley's
            seaside country estate at Felpham.  Blake included the intellectual and spiritual
            struggle with Hayley in his epic <a target="_blank" href="https://www.blakearchive.org/work/milton"><i>Milton</i></a>, in which

            sixth Thursday after Easter.  In Blake's adult lifetime there was a procession each year on a late spring Thursday (not actually
            Holy Thursday) in which all the charity-school children of London were marched in variously colored uniforms from their schools
            to a church, usually St. Paul's Cathedral, where they heard sermons about how lucky they were, and sang thanks to God, King,
            and Country.

            are <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g22" offset="55">contrary</a> states, ways of seeing and dwelling in the world.  Individuals
            in Innocence are sustained by confidence in the redemptive presence of the
            divine, perceived as both sympathetically human (often like a loving parent)
            and somehow nearby, though they may also be aware of the darker aspects of
            life.  Those in Experience are profoundly conscious of the limitations of
            fallen life and its sorrows; for them the divine may seem inhuman, inscrutable,
            impossibly distant, and cruel, though experienced visionaries, like the Bard,
            may be indignantly or transcendently aware of the infinite and eternal.

            the <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g104" offset="55">selfhood</a>; Blake rejected the "jealous God" of Exodus 20.

            giant <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g4" offset="55">Albion</a>, though she is also the city of the same name and has an assortment
            of symbolic attributes and associations.  She is Blake's true church, the

            Jesus in a tomb he built, according to legends, and later founded the first

            in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.blakearchive.org/work/milton"><i>Milton</i></a> Leutha is something like the character
            Sin in Milton's <i>Paradise Lost</i>, Book 2.  In <a target="_blank" href="https://www.blakearchive.org/work/bb209"><i>The Four Zoas</i></a> she is the emanation of <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g16" offset="55">Bromion</a>, and as sin

         </p><b id="g69"></b><p><b>Limits: </b> Limits might suggest impediments to reaching
            the eternal and infinite, but in Blake the word itself usually refers to a
            merciful limit upon various kinds of falling, as in the Limits of Opacity
            (blindness) and Contraction.
         </p><b id="g70"></b><p><b>Los: </b> Los is one of the Eternals or Four Zoas,
            the imagination, and his work as a blacksmith is to form poetry with creative
            beating.  He is the temporal manifestation of Urthona, his emanation is Enitharmon,
            and as the spirit of revolution he is the father of Luvah/Orc, passion and
            revolutionary energy respectively.
         </p><b id="g71"></b><p><b>Luvah: </b> Luvah suggests "lover," and in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.blakearchive.org/work/thel"><i>The Book of Thel</i></a> and elsewhere in Blake he is an amorous
            Christ-like figure, sometimes associated with the sun, but in his most ardent
            form he is <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g90" offset="55">Orc</a>.  He is the third of the Four Zoas.  See also <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g70" offset="55">Los</a>.

            of the plow and other agricultural tools; it is also a complex but dead mechanism,
            and became Blake's figure for Newton's materialist model of the universe.

            the epic <a target="_blank" href="https://www.blakearchive.org/work/milton"><i>Milton</i></a> indicate both Blake's admiration
            and his reservations.  Blake illustrated <a target="_blank" href="https://www.blakearchive.org/work/but536"><i>Paradise Lost</i></a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.blakearchive.org/work/but544"><i>Paradise Regained</i></a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.blakearchive.org/work/but528"><i>Comus</i></a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.blakearchive.org/work/but542"><i>On the Morning of Christ's Nativity</i></a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.blakearchive.org/work/but543"><i>L'Allegro</i> and <i>Il Penseroso,</i></a> and Blake's poetry and art in general owe

            poetry like that of the Bible.
         </p><b id="g79"></b><p><b>Mnetha: </b> Mnetha, whose name evokes both Mnemosyne

         </p><b id="g83"></b><p><b>Nature: </b> Nature is an illusory projection of the
            fallen <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g106" offset="55">senses</a> for Blake; individuals perceive the connection of nature with
            themselves and with the divine through the imagination.
         </p><b id="g84"></b><p><b>Negation: </b> A negation is the absence of a positive
            principle, as cruelty is the negation of mercy; justice, by contrast, is the
            <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g22" offset="55">contrary</a> of mercy.  
         </p><b id="g85"></b><p><b>Newton, Isaac (1642-1727): </b> Newton was not just
            a mathematician and scientist, but was also important as a philosopher; Blake
            charged him with narrow-minded mechanistic materialism.
         </p><b id="g86"></b><p><b>Nobodaddy: </b> The silliest-sounding of Blake's gods,
            Nobodaddy is a comical reduction of imaginary, abstract, paternal sky-gods
            on the model of Zeus, Jupiter and other scary and punitive God-the-Fathers.
         </p><b id="g87"></b><p><b>Of: </b> As a word that occurs in many of Blake's
            titles and other critical phrases, "of" should be considered carefully&#8212;does it mean "pertaining to," "composed of," "composed
            by," "derived from,"
            "owned by," "based on," "characterized by," a combination of these, or something
            else?
         </p><b id="g88"></b><p><b>Ololon: </b> Ololon, whose name suggests "all-alone,"

            and three daughters); also, a river, the river-dwellers, a mountain range,

               of Albion</i></a>, Oothoon is "the soft soul of America," and in Blake's later
            works she plays various roles as a woman frustrated in love.  Her name evokes
            James Macpherson's Ossianic heroine, Oithona, who fought back after being
            raped.  See also <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g26" offset="55">Dinah</a>.
         </p><b id="g90"></b><p><b>Orc: </b> Orc in Blake embodies revolutionary energy,
            an aspect of <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g71" offset="55">Luvah</a> or passion.  The so-called "Orc Cycle" in which rebel and
            tyrant eternally overthrow each other is not really Blakean.  Outside of Blake an
            orca or orc is a killer whale or, on land, a humanoid monster.
         </p><b id="g91"></b><p><b>Ox: </b>  The powerful patient masculine (if neutered)
            ox is the antithesis of tiny, aggressive "Jenny" wren.  When they were too
            old for labor, oxen were often tortured for entertainment and to tenderize
            their work-toughened muscle tissue so it could be eaten.

            he is "mild &amp; piteous" rather than loud and angry, and is distinguished
            as well from Bromion and Theotormon.  In <a target="_blank" href="https://www.blakearchive.org/work/milton"><i>Milton</i></a>,
            Palamabron struggles with the <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g75" offset="55">Miller</a>/<a href="" scroll-to-element="#g103" offset="55">Satan</a>.  His tool is the <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g55" offset="55">harrow</a>.

            side) <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g133" offset="55">weave</a> or spin.  Blake thought of engraving as a kind of plowing and
            himself as Chaucer's Plowman, but in his poetry plowing can also be a metaphor
            for the disruptive aspects of revolution or even the processes of mutability.
            Various characters use plows, including <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g125" offset="55">Urizen</a>, <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g70" offset="55">Los</a>, <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g101" offset="55">Rintrah</a>, and others.

            represents false Religion, hid in War.
         </p><b id="g99"></b><p><b>Ratio: </b>  Blake punned on "ratio," in the modern
            sense, meaning "fraction," and the word as used in older philosophy, meaning

            which means "destruction of the female," in which case the name, if it means anything, means "female."
         </p><b id="g118"></b><p><b>Theotormon: </b> Theotormon suggests "god-tormented";
            the autobiographical narrative of a mercenary who fought half-heartedly to
            suppress a slave revolt may have inspired his character in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.blakearchive.org/work/vda"><i>Visions
               of the Daughters of Albion</i></a>.  In later books Theotormon is grouped
            with Rintrah, Palamabron, and Bromion.
         </p><b id="g119"></b><p><b>Tiriel: </b> Tiriel is the son of Har and Heva in
            Blake's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.blakearchive.org/work/bb203"><i>Tiriel</i></a>.
         </p><b id="g120"></b><p><b>Tirzah: </b> Tirzah figures in a late addition to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.blakearchive.org/work/songsie"><i>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</i></a> as the "mother of [the
            speaker's] Mortal part"; she is more closely related to the sexual torturer
            Tirzah in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.blakearchive.org/work/bb209"><i>The Four Zoas</i></a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.blakearchive.org/work/milton"><i>Milton</i></a>,
            and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.blakearchive.org/work/jerusalem"><i>Jerusalem</i></a> than to a woman and a city of the same
            name in the Bible.  Blake may have chosen the name because it sounds Biblical
            and yet suggests "tears" and "teaser."  See also <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g133" offset="55">weave/weaving/woven</a>.

         </p><b id="g122"></b><p><b>Tyburn: </b> Tyburn was the site for public hangings
            in London throughout most of the eighteenth century.  Blake saw the "Tyburn
            Procession" of doomed men and women as a vestige of Druid ceremonies of human
            sacrifice.  Tyburn was rarely used after 1780, but executions continued at
            a somewhat reduced rate elsewhere.
         </p><b id="g123"></b><p><b>Tyger: </b>  In the eighteenth century tigers epitomized
            bloodthirstiness.
         </p><b id="g124"></b><p><b>Ulro: </b> Ulro is the dreariest form of the fallen
            material world, where the happiness of Beulah can only be glimpsed in dreams
            and visions.
         </p><b id="g125"></b><p><b>Urizen: </b> Urizen is one of the Eternals or <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g47" offset="55">Four Zoas</a>; he is associated with the intellect and with various forms of rationalism,
            literalism, and materialism.  Urizen is usually tyrannical or at least wants
            to be so, but he is often weak and pathetic, and occasionally heroic.  The
            name suggests the Greek god of the heavens, Uranus, and a pun on "Your Reason"
            and "Horizon," which is  the limit on perception imposed in this world by
            Your Reason.  Not all the old men with beards in Blake are Urizen, and Urizen
            is not always the bad guy.
         </p><b id="g126"></b><p><b>Urthona: </b> Urthona is the original manifestation
            of <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g70" offset="55">Los</a>, one of the <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g47" offset="55">Four Zoas</a>.  The name suggests "earth-owner," and like Los
            (and Hephaestus/Vulcan) he is a blacksmith, associated with the Imagination;
            he forges the <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g94" offset="55">plow</a>, making him an artificer if not an artist.
         </p><b id="g127"></b><p><b>Vala: </b> Vala is <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g83" offset="55">Nature</a>, and the emanation of <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g71" offset="55">Luvah</a>.
            The name is like that of a Scandinavian earth-spirit, but punningly suggests
            both "vale" and "veil," associating her with both the natural world and seductively
            coy beauty.  See also <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g129" offset="55">veil</a>, <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g133" offset="55">weave/weaving/woven</a>.
         </p><b id="g128"></b><p><b>Vegetable/vegetative: </b> Vegetable or vegetative
            is Blake's term for the state of ordinary material being, slow growing and
            merely temporal and temporary.  See also <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g96" offset="55">Polypus</a>.
         </p><b id="g129"></b><p><b>Veil: </b> In Blake the veil is typologically related
            to the temple veil between the holy of holies and the worshippers, traditionally
            rent at the moment of Jesus' death on the cross.  Veils are also associated
            with coyness, blindness, selfishness, self-enclosure, the body, and the hymen.

         </p><b id="g130"></b><p><b>Vision: </b> Vision is a term encompassing ordinary
            "single vision," mere optical reality in sequential time, and higher forms
            that perceive things prophetically, metaphorically, imaginatively, and eternally.
         </p><b id="g131"></b><p><b>Vortex: </b>  The philosopher Rene Descartes (1596-1650)
            describes a vortex as a whirling object appearing as a sun or star in space,
            throwing off light centrifugally as it spins.  A vortex can also be a whirlpool
            or whirlwind, and thus can suck things beyond itself to another dimension.
            For Blake, the vortex was a way of explaining how a "Wild Flower" can open
            up to be "a Heaven" (E 490).  Everything has its own vortex and appearance
            as one approaches it; as one passes through, it unfolds progressively on the
            other side like a globe or a sky or a man.  In <a target="_blank" href="https://www.blakearchive.org/work/bb209"><i>The Four Zoas</i></a> Urizen
            constructs a mechanistic heaven of Cartesian vortices.
         </p><b id="g132"></b><p><b>War: </b>  In this world human energies are perversely
            consumed in physical warfare, but in <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g40" offset="55">Eternity</a> warfare is an intellectual and
            creative struggle.
         </p><b id="g133"></b><p><b>Weave/weaving/woven: </b>  The traditional work of
            Eve in the fallen world is spinning or weaving, as opposed to Adam's work,
            plowing or digging (see <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g94" offset="55">plow/Plowman</a>).  Blake often
            represents the material body as having been woven; <i>Auguries
               of Innocence</i> says it is woven of alternating threads of joy and woe.  See also <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g43" offset="55">fiber</a>.
         </p><b id="g134"></b><p><b>Wheels: </b>  Most of the many wheels in Blake are
            associated at some level with the gears of a clockwork, suggesting a mechanism
            like an orrery, but some are charged with other references, such as the eyed
            wheels described in Ezekiel's account of the creatures Blake called the <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g47" offset="55">Four Zoas</a>, or with the spinning wheels of <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g34" offset="55">Enitharmon</a> (see <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g133" offset="55">weave/weaving/woven</a>).
         </p><b id="g135"></b><p><b>Will: </b>  The will is the impulse of the <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g104" offset="55">selfhood</a>.
            The female will is the impulse to self-protection and resistance to reintegration
            of the emanated feminine aspect.  See <a href="" scroll-to-element="#g33" offset="55">emanation</a>.
         </p><b id="g136"></b><p><b>Worm: </b>  Anything from a caterpillar to a maggot,
            a cankerworm or an earthworm; some of Blake's characters refer to Man as a
            worm of sixty winters or of seventy inches.
