            <h2>
                <b name="ENG" id="ENG">1. Engraving</b>
            </h2>

            <p>On 12 April 1827, shortly before he died, Blake wrote to George Cumberland thanking
                him for trying to sell copies of Blake's illuminated books and his recently
                published engraved illustrations to the Book of Job. Blake had first executed the
                Job illustrations as watercolor drawings for Thomas Butts around 1805, followed by a
                duplicate set for John Linnell, who commissioned him to engrave the series in
                1823.</p>

            <p>Three years later, Blake had 22 line engravings that looked very different from the
                tonal prints then popular. Indeed, they even looked different from engravings, his
                own included, for they were not executed in the standard "mixed method" technique,
                in which designs were first etched and then finished as engravings. In this
                technique, which Blake mastered as an apprentice, the design's outline was traced
                with a needle through an acid-resistant "ground" covering the copper plate and then
                etched with acid. The engraver went over these slightly incised lines with burins
                (metal tools with square or lozenge-shaped tips used to cut lines into the plate)
                and engraved the plates entire surface, uniting all parts in a web of crosshatched
                lines. <sup><a>ill. 1

<img src="images/1.7.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> These advances in
                technique enabled "modern" engravers to represent mass and tone more convincingly
                than the more linear style of such "ancient" engravers as Blake's heroes, Durer and
                Raimondi, whose works were often dismissed as "Hard Stiff &#38; Dry Unfinishd Works
                of Art" (anno. Reynolds, E 639). The Job engravings were executed entirely with
                burins and without preliminary etching, with tone subordinate to line and texture
                and with lines amassed in parallel strokes rather than in the conventional "dot and
                lozenge" pattern (dots incised in the interstices of cross-hatched lines, the linear
                system characteristic of bank-note engraving; see <sup><a>ill. 8

<img src="images/1.9.pre.jpg"/></a> <a>ill. 10
<img src="images/1.10.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> .
                Blake's emulation of the ancient engravers produced a modern result: original
                artistic expression in a graphic medium whose materiality and natural language were
                fully exploited. <sup><a>ill. 11
<img src="images/1.11.pre.jpg"/></a> <a>ill. 12
<img src="images/1.12.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> It was the masterpiece of his lifetime
                as an engraver, but it would be a tough sell, as Blake and Linnell, who had 315 sets
                printed in early 1826, must both have realized.<sup><a class="footnote">note 1<span>215 proof sets were printed on special
    papers for connoisseurs and sold at L6.6s., and 100 sets were printed on
    regular paper, at L3.3s. For Blakes apprenticeship and lifelong development as
    a graphic artist, see Essick, <i>William Blake, Printmaker</i>.</span></a></sup> </p>

            <p>Works that Blake had in stock were not selling well. Even if the illuminated books
                might do better, as Cumberland supposed, the prospect of printing new copies did not
                excite their maker: ...having none remaining of all that I had Printed I cannot
                Print more Except at a great loss for at the time I printed those things I had a
                whole House to range in now I am shut up in a Corner therefore am forced to ask a
                Price for them that I scarce expect to get from a Stranger. I am now Printing a Set
                of the Songs of Innocence &#38; Experience for a Friend at Ten Guineas which I
                cannot do under Six Months consistent with my other Work, so that I have little hope
                of doing any more of such things. the Last Work I produced is a Poem Entitled
                Jerusalem the Emanation of the Giant Albion, but find that to Print it will Cost my
                Time the amount of Twenty Guineas One I have Finishd It contains 100 Plates but it
                is not likely that I shall get a Customer for it (letter of 12 April 1827, E 783-84)
                Though dubious about their prospects, Blake listed six books he was willing to
                reprint&#8212;at about twenty times the prices advertised in his 1793 Prospectus (E
                693).</p>

            <p>Producing new copies of any illuminated book had become far more labor intensive,
                with each illuminated page now printed on one side of the leaf and elaborately
                colored, framed with lines, and often touched with gold leaf. Impressions now looked
                more like miniature paintings, a far cry from those produced in the 1790s, when
                plates were usually printed on both sides of the paper and lightly colored to look
                more like pages than prints or paintings. But six months?</p>

            <p>Blake's "Corner" was two fair-sized rooms in the Strand&#8212;much less space than the
                "eight or ten rooms" (BR 560) in Lambeth, where from 1790 to 1800 he had written,
                designed, etched, printed, and colored <i>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</i>
                (1790), <i>Visions of the Daughters of Albion</i>, <i>America a Prophecy</i>, <i>For
                    Children: The Gates of Paradise</i> (all 1793), <i>Europe a Prophecy</i>,
                    <i>Songs of Experience</i>, the combined <i>Songs of Innocence and of
                    Experience</i>, <i>The First Book of Urizen</i> (all 1794), <i>The Book of
                    Los</i>, <i>The Song of Los</i>, and <i>The Book of Ahania</i> (all 1795), and
                where he also reprinted copies of his earlier works, <i>All Religions are One</i>
                and <i>There is No Natural Religion</i> (1788), <i>Songs of Innocence</i> (1789),
                and <i>The Book of Thel</i> (1789-90). By 1795, Blake had produced over 125 copies
                of the 168 surviving copies of illuminated books.<sup><a class="footnote">note 2<span>This total omits the works of one plate,
 <i>On Homers Poetry</i> and <i>Laocoön</i>,
 and two plates, <i>The Ghost of Abel</i>.</span></a></sup> </p>

            <p>Clearly, six months was a lot of time to devote to an illuminated book. Of the 111
                engravings that Blake had produced between 1789 and 1795, he had executed 80 between
                1790 and 1793, which suggests that he concentrated on illuminated printing during
                1789-90 and 1793-95, intervals that correspond exactly with the books' dates, and
                that he underwrote the cost of his original productions with his commercial work.
                From one medium-sized engraving, Blake could earn &#163;15-30 (E 703) or as much as &#163; 80
                (BR 569). Had he sold his entire stock of illuminated books at their initial prices,
                he would have made less than &#163;50, barely enough to pay for the copper and paper, let
                alone his labor (Bentley, "Price of Experience" 628-29). By 1795, with a stock of
                illuminated books, he began to redirect his considerable energies toward other
                projects. These included twelve large color-print drawings, 537 watercolor
                illustrations to Edward Young's <i>Night Thoughts</i>, 43 of which he engraved, 117
                illustrations to Gray's <i>Poems</i>, the <i>Four Zoas</i> manuscript, and a series
                of tempera paintings for Butts. The 1790s were his most successful period
                financially, not from the sale of illuminated books but from the steady employment
                by the book and print publishers and his patron. After the intense early periods of
                illuminated printing, the books never again commanded center stage in his life; even
                the 150 plates of the major prophecies <i>Milton</i> (c. 1811) and <i>Jerusalem</i>
                (c. 1820) were written and etched over many years consistent with his "other
                Work."</p>

            <p>In 1800 the Blakes left London to spend three years in Felpham. On their return they
                took a first-floor apartment in South Molton Street. Their living quarters became
                smaller with each move, more suitable for engraving and painting than printing. At
                Felpham, Blake may have printed a few separate copies of <i>Innocence</i> and
                    <i>Experience</i>; at South Molton Street, he wrote and printed <i>Milton</i>
                and <i>Jerusalem</i>, probably revised <i>For Children</i>, and reprinted nine other
                illuminated books&#8212;about 29 copies altogether. These were the years of Blake's 1809
                exhibition, illustrations to Blair's <i>Grave</i>, illustrations to Milton, most of
                the Bible illustrations, and the Canterbury Pilgrims engraving. By contrast, when
                Cumberland wrote him at Fountain Court, he had etched only three illuminated plates,
                for <i>On Homers Poetry</i> (c. 1822) and <i>The Ghost of Abel</i> (1822), and had
                printed only four copies of <i>Songs</i> (copies W and Y in 1825, Z and AA in 1826).
                But, as implied in his letter to Cumberland, he remained as busy as ever.</p>

            <p>Blake had been illustrating Dante's <i>Divine Comedy</i> for over two years.
                    <sup><a>ill. 13
<img src="images/1.13.pre.jpg"/></a> <a>ill. 14
<img src="images/1.14.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> When he wrote Cumberland, he had 102 designs and was
                engraving seven of them. As he told Linnell, "I am too much attachd to Dante to
                think much of any thing else&#8212;I have Proved the Six Plates &#38; reduced the Fighting
                Devils ready for the Copper I count myself sufficiently Paid If I live as I now do"
                (letter of 25 April 1827, E 784). The other work was a copy of <i>Marriage</i> (I)
                and one of <i>Songs</i> (X), the "Set of the Songs" he was "now Printing." Both were
                highly finished in gold, watercolors, and pen and ink. His very last book, though,
                was uncolored copy F of <i>Jerusalem</i>, a commission secured by Linnell a few
                weeks after he wrote Cumberland. Its "100 Plates" did not, however, sell for "Twenty
                Guineas"; Blake completed it on his deathbed, and its &#163;5.5s. sale price helped to
                pay for his burial.<sup><a class="footnote">note 3<span>Blake died of liver failure; for a possible connection
 between that and chronic copper intoxication, see Viscomi and Robson, Blakes
 Death.</span></a></sup> </p>

            <p>Three books in six months. Printing illuminated books was still possible, but more
                difficult than before because they demanded greater artistic attention, disrupted
                other work, and required more space. The place they occupied in Blake's life had
                changed. How different things had been with "a whole House to range in," where he
                could spread out and move through the stages of illuminated printing, from preparing
                plates and designing pages, to etching and printing designs, to coloring and
                collating impressions, as though moving through the six days of creation&#8212;or the six
                "chambers" of the "Printing house in Hell" (<i>MHH</i> 15, E 40).</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2><b name="NPT" id="NPT">2. New Printing Technologies</b>
                </h2>

                <p>Fifteen of Blake's 19 illuminated works were executed in a relief-etching
                    technique he had invented in 1788. In his prospectus of 1793 he called it
                    "Illuminated Printing" and announced that he had "invented a method of Printing
                    both Letter-press and Engraving in a style more ornamental, uniform, and grand,
                    than any before discovered, while it produces works at less than one fourth of
                    the expense"; he defined it as "a method of Printing which combines the Painter
                    and the Poet" (Prospectus, E 692-93). Though he never explained the technique,
                    he did describe his "infernal method" as "melting apparent surfaces away, and
                    displaying the infinite which was hid" (<i>MHH</i> 14, E 39). In "a Printing
                    house in Hell," he "saw the method in which knowledge is transmitted from
                    generation to generation," and allegorized its major stages as fantastic acts in
                    six "chambers," where a "cave," symbolizing the copper plate, was made
                    "infinite" and "cast" into the "expanse" (<i>MHH</i> 15, E 40).</p>

                <p>In practice, Blake wrote texts and drew illustrations with pens and brushes on
                    copper plates in acid-resistant ink and, with nitric acid, etched away the
                    unprotected metal to bring the composite design into printable relief. He
                    printed the plates in colored inks on a rolling press and tinted most
                    impressions in watercolors. While the combination of word and image is a
                    prominent feature of illuminated printing, it appears not to have been the
                    impetus for the invention. He credited the method to a vision of his recently
                    deceased brother Robert, and first used it for The <i>Approach of Doom</i>
                    (Viscomi, <i>Idea</i> 172; see also Essick, <i>Separate Plates</i>, III), a
                    print in imitation of Robert's wash drawing. <sup><a>ill. 1
<img src="images/2.1.pre.jpg"/></a> <a>ill. 2
<img src="images/2.2.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> The first
                    works to incorporate text were <i>All Religions are One</i> and <i>No Natural
                        Religion</i>, small philosophical tractates on perception and the "Poetic
                    Genius." The following year he used the technique to publish poetry, beginning
                    with <i>Innocence</i> and <i>Thel</i>.</p>

                <p>Illuminated printing was not mysterious, complex, or difficult. The pens,
                    brushes, and liquid medium enabled Blake to design directly on copper plates as
                    though he were drawing on paper, which in turn encouraged him to integrate text
                    and illustration on the same page. Technically, such integration was possible in
                    conventional (intaglio) etching (as in <i>Ahania</i>), but the economics of
                    publishing had long defined etching as image reproduction and letterpress as
                    text reproduction, so that the conventional illustrated book was the product of
                    much divided labor, with illustrations produced and printed in one medium and
                    shop and separately inserted into leaves printed elsewhere in letterpress on a
                    different kind of press. Even when words and images were brought together on the
                    same leaf, divisions in production were maintained.</p>

                <p>Whether Blake used relief or intaglio, as author illustrating and printing
                    himself, he would have united the various stages of book production, obtaining
                    control over the production of his illustrated text the same way he did as a
                    graphic artist over his own images. The tools of drawing and sketching, though,
                    freed him to think in new ways, to unite invention and execution in ways
                    defeated by conventional printmaking. Moreover, the idea that an artist's first
                    and spontaneous thoughts are most valuable because they are closest to the
                    original creative spark, often obliterated by high finishing, had become very
                    popular in the late eighteenth century, creating a taste for drawings and
                    sketches and motivating printmakers to invent techniques to reproduce them in
                    facsimile and to simulate their various textures (e.g., chalk, crayon, pen and
                    wash; see <sup><a>ill. 3

                        <a>ill. 12
<img src="images/2.12.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> . Such prints, however, were carefully executed with needles,
                    roulettes (a textured wheel used to roughen the plate's surface to produce
                    tonalities), and other metal tools, their spontaneity a crafted illusion. Blake,
                    on the other hand, by actually using the tools and techniques of writing and
                    drawing, had solved the technical problem of reproducing pen and brush marks in
                    metal. He created a multi-media site where poetry, painting, and printmaking
                    came together in ways both original and characteristic of Romanticism's
                    fascination with spontaneity and the idea of the sketch.<sup><a class="footnote">note 4<span>For the origins of illuminated printing, see Viscomi,

                </h2>
                <i>In the first chamber was a Dragon-Man, clearing away the rubbish from a caves
                    mouth; within, a number of Dragons were hollowing the cave</i>

                <p>No printmaker before Blake had incorporated the tools and techniques of writing,
                    drawing, and painting in a graphic medium, though the materials and tools were
                    commonplace. The varnishes, acid, inks, dabbers, brushes, quills, oils, colors,
                    and paper were in every engraver's workshop&#8212;along with the main ingredient, the
                    copper plate. Plates were purchased from coppersmiths, usually cut to size.
                    Because intaglio etchings and engravings had to be printed with pressure great
                    enough to force paper into the incised lines, which resulted in a "platemark" or
                    embossment that revealed the plate's shape, engravers neatly squared the plate
                    and bevelled the sides to prevent them from cutting the paper. For relief
                    etching, Blake cut small plates out of larger sheets himself, cutting them
                    roughly equal size but not uniformly, using either a hammer and chisel or
                    scoring the sheet deeply with a burin and snapping it between boards <sup><a>ill. 1
<img src="images/3.1.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> . Because he printed from raised surfaces rather than incised lines,
                    he used less pressure and avoided pronounced platemarks, and consequently he
                    dispensed with squaring and bevelling. Equally unorthodox, he etched both sides
                    of plates (e.g., <i>Experience</i>, <i>Europe</i>, and <i>Urizen</i> were etched
                    on the backs of <i>Innocence</i>, <i>America</i>, and <i>Marriage</i> plates).
                    Cutting the cost of copper, his most expensive material, the "verso" books were
                    the only ones to turn a profit at the time (Bentley, "Price of Experience"
                    635).</p>

                <p>Blake prepared plates for relief etching as he did for intaglio etching. He
                    planed plates on an anvil with a hammer (the tools of Los in Blake's mythology),
                    and then, with water, oil, and various grinding stones, polished the surface to
                    a mirror-like finish <sup><a>ill. 2
<img src="images/3.2.pre.jpg"/></a> <a>ill. 3
<img src="images/3.3.pre.jpg"/></a> <a>ill. 4
<img src="images/3.4.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> . Polishing made plates
                    easier to cut with burins or needles and easier to wipe clean of ink, but it
                    deposited a greasy film that had to be removed, otherwise either the etching
                    ground or Blake's "ink" would have adhered to the film rather than metal and
                    could have flaked from the plate in the acid bath <sup><a>ill. 5
<img src="images/3.5.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> . Because
                    relief etchings required a long bite in strong acid, thorough and correct
                    "degreasing" with chalk or breadcrumbs was of the utmost importance <sup><a>ill. 6

                    <b name="CH2" id="CH2">4. Chamber Two: Executing the Design</b>
                </h2>

            <i>In the second chamber was a Viper folding round the rock &#38; the cave, and others
                adorning it with gold, silver and precious stones</i>

            <p>In intaglio etching, Blake melted a ball of ground consisting of wax and resins and
                spread it over a warm degreased plate <sup><a>ill. 1
<img src="images/4.1.pre.jpg"/></a> <a>ill. 2
<img src="images/4.2.pre.jpg"/></a> <a>ill. 3
<img src="images/4.3.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> . He smoked
                the ground to darken and harden it, transferred the design onto it, and cut through
                the design with a needle <sup><a>ill. 4
<img src="images/4.4.pre.jpg"/></a> <a>ill. 5
<img src="images/4.5.pre.jpg"/></a> <a>ill. 6

<img src="images/4.8.pre.jpg"/></a> <a>ill. 9
<img src="images/4.9.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> . The
                metal thus exposed was bitten below the surface with acid. In relief etching,
                though, he drew the design directly on a clean copper plate with pens and brushes
                using a liquid medium. Like the etching ground, this medium had to be acid-resistant
                but it also had to flow easily, adhere when dry, not spread or blot on the plate,
                and be usable with pens and brushes. In short, it had to behave like writing ink.
                Linnell identified Blake's "impervious liquid" (<i>BR</i> 460n1) as being the usual
                "stop-out" varnish that etchers used to paint over lines sufficiently etched to
                "stop" the acid from biting them deeper <sup><a>ill. 10
<img src="images/4.10.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> . By stopping out lines
                and biting plates in successive stages, etchers varied the depth and width of
                lines&#8212;much as engravers did by cutting them deeper with their diamond-shaped burins.
                Varying the amount of ink that lines held altered their tone, making possible the
                modeling of forms and the illusion of aerial perspective.</p>

            <p>Blake did not invent his writing medium; he merely adapted one of the brown
                asphaltum-based stop-out varnishes. With plate, acid-resistant "ink," pens, and
                brushes, he entered the second chamber and, like "a Viper folding round the rock
                &#38; the cave," he rewrote his text, first drafted on paper, and illustrated it in
                a sinuous, calligraphic hand <sup><a>ill. 12
<img src="images/4.17.pre.jpg"/></a> <a>ill. 13
<img src="images/4.11.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> . By cutting into broad
                areas painted in stop-out, he created fine white and black parallel lines <sup><a>ill. 14
<img src="images/4.12.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> ; by cutting the nib of his quill, he varied the strokes of his
                letters.</p>

            <p>Because the printed image mirrors the plate image, Blake rewrote his text backwards,
                an "art" his friends acknowledged he "excel[led] in" (<i>BR</i> 212n1)&#8212;and which he
                pictures himself doing in Jerusalem plate 37<sup><a>ill. 
<img src="images/4.13.pre.jpg"/></a></sup>. He usually started
                with text and illustrated around it, visually composing the page design while
                executing it <sup><a>ill. 15
<img src="images/4.15.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> . How different this was from the way he worked as
                an etcher and engraver&#8212;from all etchers and engravers&#8212;even when executing original
                designs. Their methods and objectives prevented designing directly in the metal; the
                image they reproduced was first worked up on paper and then transferred to the plate
                as a guide for the needle. Likewise, the engraver needed the lightly etched outline
                because the burin cuts rather than draws lines, translating them into
                three-dimensional lines of varying depth and width. But the methods used by
                engravers to transfer designs did not work in relief etching, and there was no
                technical need for Blake to transfer the page design or any of its parts, since he
                was engaged neither in cutting it into the plate nor in translating it into
                different kinds of lines. The tools and Blake's twenty years of drawing experience
                enabled him to design his pages as he rewrote his texts on the plates, as though
                creating an illuminated manuscript.</p>

            <p>No illuminated designs that might have been transferred or even redrawn are extant,
                nor are there any mockups of designs except for two roughly composed, textless
                pencil sketches for <i>Thel</i> plates 6 and 7 <sup><a>ill. 17
<img src="images/4.16.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> , and both differ
                considerably from the printed designs <sup><a>ill. 11
<img src="images/4.17.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> . Blake realized very early
                that his new medium's autographic nature made the poem the only prerequisite for
                executing plates, that rewriting texts was also an act of visual invention, and thus
                that the medium could be used for production rather than reproduction. With no
                designs to transfer or reproduce, the placement and extent of text, letter size,
                line spacing, as well as placement and extent of illustration, were invented only
                during execution.<sup><a class="footnote">note 5<span>After 1800, Blake invented two variations on relief
    etching (E 694). These required outlines to be transferred on etching grounds
    and the whites scraped or scratched through with oval and pointed
    needles to create images loosely resembling woodcuts or wood engravings (e.g.,
    <i>Jerusalem</i> Plates 14 and 33). Accompanying text was
    still written backwards and the page designed when executed.</span></a></sup> This method of designing meant that Blake did not know what
                lines or stanza would go on what plate, or how many plates a poem/book would need.
                Working without models allowed each illuminated print and book to evolve through its
                production in ways impossible in conventional book-making. Blake could begin working
                on a book before it was completely written.<sup><a class="footnote">note 6<span>See Viscomi, The Evolution of William Blakes
 <i>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</i>.</span></a></sup></p>

            <p>While writing backwards was not difficult, mastering the "ink" and giving small
                letters the proper slant were, at least initially. Blake could dip brushes directly
                in the ink, but probably loaded the quill pens used for text with a small brush, a
                method illuminators used to keep quills from clogging <sup><a>ill. 12
<img src="images/5.1.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> . And like
                illuminators of manuscripts, he may have slanted his plates to keep his quill as
                horizontal as possible. Blake could write texts in roman or italic lettering&#8212;he used
                both in <i>No Natural Religion</i>&#8212;but he quickly favored the latter, which was
                easier to write and, with fewer letter ends to coordinate, to keep straight and
                uniform. Italic script also facilitated the next stage: with fewer letter ends
                exposed to acid, words were better protected against problems caused by the acid
                pitting and lifting the ground. Tight designs also exemplified Blake's thinking in
                terms of his medium: to be printable, they do not need to be bitten as deeply as
                designs with open spaces, and thus require less time in acid. Their dense line
                systems also facilitated inking by keeping the ink dabber on the surface and clear
                of the "shallows," the areas bitten below the surface meant to print white.</p>

                <b name="CH3" id="CH3">5. Chamber Three: Etching with Acid</b>
            </h2>

            <i>In the third chamber was an Eagle with wings and feathers of air, he caused the
                inside of the cave to be infinite, around were numbers of Eagle like men, who built
                palaces in the immense cliffs</i>

            <p>Blake had to etch accurately to retain the autographic quality of his designs. The
                acid&#8212;or "aquafortis"&#8212;commonly employed in his day was diluted nitric. Acid is
                unpredictable, affected by age, temperature, humidity, and the metal's
                purity&#8212;especially in relief etching, because the large amount of exposed metal heats
                it and makes it bite more viciously. Such "corrosives" may be "salutary and
                medicinal...in Hell" (<i>MHH</i> 14, E 39), but on earth they emit noxious orange
                fumes and require good ventilation. Blake embedded the plate's edges in strips of
                wax to create a self-contained tray and poured the acid about a quarter inch deep
                    <sup><a>ill. 10
<img src="images/5.2.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> . He watched it turn blue and gas bubbles form along the
                design&#8212;more bubbles than he had ever seen before, signs of trouble <sup><a>ill. 2
<img src="images/5.3.pre.jpg"/></a> ill. 11</sup> . He passed a feather&#8212;the conventional tool to agitate the acid&#8212;over
                the design <sup><a>ill. 12
<img src="images/5.4.pre.jpg"/></a> <a>ill. 13
<img src="images/5.5.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> , doing so every few minutes as bubbles began
                to reform, to keep the acid from undercutting or lifting the design: "an Eagle with
                wings and feathers of air...caused the inside of the cave to be infinite." Looking
                down on the flat, dark-brown design on reddish copper in its cloudy blue-tinted
                bath, he was like Rintrah, shaking "his fires in the burdend air," watching "hungry
                clouds swag on the deep" (<i>MHH</i> 2, E 33). Indeed, he was the Spirit of God that
                "was upon the face of the deep...divid[ing] the light from the darkness" (Gen.
                1.1-4).</p>

            <p>Hours, not days, later, unetched surfaces were divided from shallows and a relief
                plate was created. Like a god brooding over creation&#8212;pictured on <i>Marriage</i>
                plate 14&#8212;Blake was "Melting apparent surfaces away, and displaying the infinite
                which was hid" (E 39). Displayed, of course, was the composite design now visible in
                relief, metaphorically materialized as "immense cliffs" large enough to house
                "palaces" built by "Eagle like men," assistants in the "image" and "likeness" of the
                Eagle, as signs of their "dominion" (Gen. 1.26). The cliffs and valleys of this
                small copper plate were indeed a minute particular manifesting creation itself.</p>

            <p>Under the watchful eyes of Blake or his trusted "devil," or printer's assistant, his
                wife Catherine, etching could take much of the day; no doubt a few plates were
                etched at the same time&#8212;but not in one long continuous bite of the acid. In intaglio
                etching, he stopped out selected areas and etched the plate in successive stages to
                vary line depth and tone <sup><a>ill. 4
<img src="images/5.6.pre.jpg"/></a> <a>ill. 5

<img src="images/5.11.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> . But
                relief lines are all on the same level and thus receive equal amounts of ink; like
                woodcuts, they are essentially two-dimensional, boldly contrasting black-and-white
                forms incapable of producing tonal gradation. Nevertheless, Blake stopped out his
                plates at least once. (A two-stage etch is indicated by steps around the relief
                plateaus of Blake's only surviving relief-etched copperplate, a fragment from a
                rejected <i>America</i> plate. <sup><a>ill. 18
<img src="images/5.12.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> ) After 45 to 90 minutes of
                etching, his design was in slight relief. He poured off the acid, dried the plate,
                and then carefully painted over words with stop out to protect details from lifting
                during a longer second bite, which was necessary to deepen the areas around words
                and lines. <sup><a>ill. 14
<img src="images/5.13.pre.jpg"/></a> <a>ill. 15
<img src="images/5.14.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> Only if the "ink" started to lift would there
                be additional stopping out.</p>

            <p>A long day, but at the end, a printable image was created many times more quickly
                than by engraving, where a square inch of close cross-hatching could take a full day
                or more. After etching the design into printable relief, pouring off the acid, and
                removing the wax walls <sup><a>ill. 16
<img src="images/5.15.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> , Blake erased the "ink" with turpentine
                and polished the plate <sup><a>ill. 17
<img src="images/5.16.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> ). He was now ready to make printing
                ink.</p>

            <i>In the fourth chamber were Lions of flaming fire raging around &#38; melting the

            <p>Ink for relief and intaglio printing was made by grinding powdered pigment with
                different grades of burnt walnut or linseed oil. <sup><a>ill. 1

                Intaglio ink is tackier and stiffer <sup><a>ill. 4

                used it to print relief plates, as is evinced by the slightly reticulated surfaces
                of his prints, especially noticeable in solid areas. He inked plates on the intaglio
                printer's conventional charcoal brazier, whose low heat made stiff ink thinner and
                more fluid and thus easier to manipulate and spread. Like a "Lion[] of flaming fire
                raging around &#38; melting the metals into living fluids," he spread glistening,
                warm ink with a linen dabber, moving its slightly convex bottom across the plate's
                surface and off the shallows. <sup><a>ill. 8
<img src="images/6.6.pre.jpg"/></a> <a>ill. 9
<img src="images/6.7.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> Plates with wide shallows he
                inked locally with small dabbers or brushes. Even so, inking relief plates was
                quicker than intaglio plates, which required a two-step process of rubbing ink into
                the lines and wiping the surface clean with rags and the palm of the hand. <sup><a>ill. 5
<img src="images/6.8.pre.jpg"/></a> <a>ill. 6

<img src="images/6.10.pre.jpg"/></a></sup>
            </p>

            <p>Blake wiped the ink from any relief surfaces he did not wish to print. He routinely
                wiped the thin line bordering the plate created by the wax dike used to hold the
                acid. <sup><a>ill. 10
<img src="images/6.11.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> The borders formed part of the plate's relief line system
                and acted as runners for the dabber. Wiping them was similar to wiping the bevelled
                edges of intaglio plates to prevent them from blemishing the platemark. The result,
                however, was very different. Platemarks, clean or not, always reveal a plate's shape
                and hence the image's origin and medium. Because relief etchings produce no
                pronounced platemark, wiping the borders erased overt signs of the graphic medium.
                The unframed text and image looked written and drawn rather than printed, a unique
                rather than a repeatable image, an illusion further enhanced by colored inks and
                watercolor finishing.</p>

            <p>The books were "Printed in Colours" (Prospectus, E 693). The first printing of
                    <i>Thel</i>, for example, yielded thirteen (surviving) copies in five different
                colors. Changing inks during a print run diversified stock but also required more
                time, but it was not as labor intensive as color printing, in which a few thick
                opaque colors were applied to the plate's surfaces and shallows, sometimes heavily,
                sometimes lightly, and printed with the inked design. Blake had adapted the <i>á la
                    poup&#233;e</i> technique English printers used for color printing, and used it for
                nearly everything he printed in 1794-95.<sup><a class="footnote">note 7<span>French printers favored the multi-plate mode of color
    printing: a key plate prints the outline and separate plates, registered
    exactly onto the key plate, carry one or more colors. For a detailed
    examination of Blakes color printing method and others of his day, see
    Essick and Viscomi, Inquiry and Blakes
    Method.</span></a></sup> In effect, he painted plates with
                small dabbers (<i>poup&#233;es</i>) to produce opaque colors and textures resembling oil
                sketches <sup><a>ill. 11
<img src="images/6.12.pre.jpg"/></a> <a>ill. 12

                and pen and ink. <sup><a>ill. 13
<img src="images/6.14.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> In 1795, he brilliantly extended color printing
                more fully into painting, executing "12 Large Prints...Printed in
                Colours...unaccompanied by any writing." <sup><a>ill. 14
<img src="images/7.1.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> He rarely used the
                technique for books after that, though in 1796 he created the Large and Small Books
                of Designs for, appropriately enough, a miniaturist painter, by color printing a
                "selection" of plates "from the different Books of such as could be Printed without
                the Writing" (letter of 9 June 1818, E 771).</p>

                <b name="CH5" id="CH5">7. Chamber Five: Printing and Coloring Impressions</b>
            </h2>

            <i>In the fifth chamber were Unnamd forms, which cast the metals into the expanse</i>

            <p>From the inking station, Blake went to the press, where he again met Mrs. Blake, his
                printing "devil." Simultaneously the dirtiest and cleanest of arts, involving oily
                inks and pristine paper, printing was best performed by two people. Printers,
                though, went unnamed in inscriptions on reproductive prints, which recorded date,
                title, artist, publisher, and engraver. Blake signed most illuminated works "Author
                &#38; Printer W. Blake" or "Printed by W. Blake," taking pride in his manual as well
                as mental labor. The fifth chamber's unpictureable image also puns on "form," which
                is type set into pages in a metal frame for printing. "Cast," another printing pun,
                refers to a stereotype (a solid body of type), as well as to the mold in which
                molten metals are poured; here, the mold shaping the "living...metals" is the
                "expanse" of blank sheets of paper, which now embody the relief plates' immense
                cliffs, valleys, and palaces.</p>

            <p>Blake printed on "the most beautiful wove paper that could be procured" (Prospectus,
                E 693)&#8212;the kind used by engravers. And he prepared it as a printmaker rather than a
                book printer, tearing large sheets of paper into quarters, eights, or twelves,
                instead of printing the sheet and then folding it into pages. Depending on the size
                of the sheet and how he cut it, the resulting leaves were basically big, medium, and
                small, or, according to Blake, "folio," "quarto," and "octavo," because they roughly
                corresponded with those standard book sizes (he advertised <i>Songs</i>, for
                example, as "octavo"). Like all intaglio and relief printers of the day, he dampened
                the paper for printing. <sup><a>ill. 1
<img src="images/7.2.pre.jpg"/></a></sup></p>

            <p>Blake had taught his wife how to print, draw, and color, and was especially proud of
                her printing abilities. She proofed and printed both his relief and intaglio plates
                    (<i>BR</i> 459 <sup><a>ill. 2
<img src="images/7.3.pre.jpg"/></a> <a>ill. 3
<img src="images/7.4.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> ). For relief plates, they decreased the
                pressure on their rolling press (a machine with two large cylinders between which a
                board passes when the top cylinder is turned) by slightly raising the roller and
                probably removing one of three felt blankets placed between plate and roller. Blake
                laid the inked plate on the bed of the press, face up. Mrs. Blake held top and
                bottom of a damp sheet of paper and lowered it onto the plate, being careful not to
                let it sag in the middle and touch the ink, or to move it once it touched the plate;
                otherwise some lines would print double or slightly out of focus. She covered the
                leaf registered to the plate with a backing sheet and blankets and turned the
                press's handle to pull the bed smoothly between two heavy rollers. <sup><a>ill. 4
<img src="images/7.5.pre.jpg"/></a></sup>
                After the "marriage" of inked plate and paper, she removed the printed impression
                    <sup><a>ill. 5
<img src="images/7.6.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> to dry and brought another leaf to the press as Blake brought
                another plate, returning the printed plate to the brazier to be reinked.</p>

            <p>Printing impressions without pronounced platemarks meant Blake could print on both
                sides of leaves to create facing pages. This conventional book format used less
                paper, which was Blake's largest expense other than metal, but could present
                difficulties. Mrs. Blake registered the clean side of the paper just printed onto
                the newly inked plate, and covered the printed side with a stiff backing sheet or
                thin metal plate (which she could wipe of offset ink and reuse). Offset was minimal,
                as in letterpress printing, because the ink was slightly pressed into the paper, and
                thus below the surface. Alternatively, Blake could print a stack of leaves and then
                print the versos (kept damp) once the ink was dry to the touch. In 1794, when Blake
                began color printing his plates <sup><a>ill. 6
<img src="images/7.7.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> , he also began routinely printing
                on only one side of the paper, which, though easier, changed the dynamic between
                book and reader: with no competing image, the solo design dominated the page spread,
                demanding full attention and, in this format, came to demand more of Blake as it
                became increasingly more painterly.</p>

            <p>By alternating plates, the Blakes kept the press in action and could efficiently
                print a dozen impressions in an hour. Printing eleven copies of an eleven-plate book
                like <i>Visions</i> (121 impressions) would take less than two full days. Normally,
                they printed one plate at a time, but for small plates, such as Songs, they could
                print two, each onto a separate leaf, halving their printing time. Registration of
                paper to plate was sometimes off, resulting in designs hanging low or high, slanted
                left or right. Blake did not mind; he appears to have rarely discarded impressions,
                since the quality of inking, printing, and registration varies within copies of
                books. Creating pages with uniform margins was impossible with plates only roughly
                equal in size, and given how they were cut, it is not likely that Blake was very
                exacting about registration. He did not abhor accidents, but saw them as part of the
                creative process, as revealing the maker's hand and production process.</p>

            <p>Hell's "Printing house" has no chamber explicitly designated for coloring
                impressions. The infernal printmakers, however, incorporated ornamentation and color
                into the second and fourth chambers: the brushes illustrating text were also
                "adorning it with gold, silver, and precious stones," and the "living fluids" of
                colored inks were inherently illuminating. Blake's 1793 prospectus does not
                explicitly state that impressions were hand colored, only that they were "Printed in
                Colours." But "illuminated" implies coloring, specifically of manuscripts, and" a
                method of Printing which combines the Painter and the Poet" implies the same.</p>

            <p>As with quills, inks, and varnishes, Blake made his own watercolors. He ground many
                of the same pigments used to make ink in water and gum arabic <sup><a>ill. 8
<img src="images/7.8.pre.jpg"/></a></sup>
                instead of oil, and, to make the thicker, more opaque colors, in a thin carpenters
                glue, diluting the paste with water to vary the paint layer's consistency. <sup><a>ill. 9
<img src="images/7.9.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> In the early days, when he printed in earth tones (yellow ochre and raw
                sienna mostly), he applied broad, delicate washes in only a few colors, and usually
                left texts unwashed. <sup><a>ill. 10
<img src="images/7.10.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> He printed late works in red and orange
                inks, bright colors that invited a more extensive palette and elaborate coloring
                    <sup><a>ill. 11
<img src="images/7.11.pre.jpg"/></a></sup> . He applied colors in thin washes and translucent layers
                with detailed brushwork, adding blues, pinks, or yellows behind text and often
                outlining texts and illustrations in pen and ink. The result was a beautiful,
                strongly linear miniature, with legibility sometimes compromised.</p>

            <p>He and his wife shared the task of illuminating the prints, at least in the first
                productions, perhaps adapting the method print publishers used when coloring prints,
                with each colorist using one or two colors and then passing the impression to the
                next colorist to add another color or two. For some books, Blake may have finished
                an impression from each stack of pages as a model, but neither he nor Mrs. Blake
                copied the other exactly. Making each impression exactly repeatable (as one would
                expect of books and prints) was not really possible when working by hand with an
                assistant. While each copy produced was a unique work of art, most impressions
                printed and colored at the same time do not differ very much; they share printing
                style, colors, coloring style, and even placement of colors. Making each impression
                    <i>very</i> different would have required more labor and time, and, given the
                objective of producing multiple copies of books "at less than one fourth of the
                expense," would have been inefficient. Books printed in different periods, though,
                were also printed and colored in different styles and are visually very different.
                Overt differences among copies, in other words, usually reveal different periods and
                styles of production and not revision of the particular work.</p>

                <b name="CH6" id="CH6">8. Chamber Six: Prints into Books</b>
            </h2>
            <i>There they were reciev'd by Men who occupied the sixth chamber, and took the forms of
                books &#38; were arranged in libraries</i>
            <p>The sixth chamber conflates two actions, collating leaves to form copies of books and
                distributing them. It also implicitly questions the reception&#8212;and perception&#8212;of the
                book.</p>

            <p>Like other book publishers of the day, the Blakes knew purchasers would have their
                books professionally bound. They merely fastened the leaves between two sheets of
                laid paper by tying string through three or more stab holes. <sup><a>ill. 1
<img src="images/8.1.pre.jpg"/></a> ill. 2</sup> (They varied the plate order for many of the early books, most notably
                for <i>Songs</i> and <i>Urizen</i>.) And like the publishers, they warehoused or
                "arranged" their copies in the printing house. But the "sixth chamber" is also
                    <i>outside</i> the printing house, in "the expanse" into which the metals were
                "cast." The "expanse" is, ironically, the private space defined by the blank paper
                in the studio, but it is also the public space occupied by that paper as it moves
                from production to reception. After its gloriously sublime journey, touched by
                "Dragons," "Vipers," "Eagles," "Lions," "Unnamd forms," and now "Men," the
                illuminated print shelved in a library seems anticlimactic. But is it? As a "cast"
                of the original plate, it extends Hell's Printing house to the place of reading. Do
                the "fires of hell...look like torment and insanity or an immense world of delight"?
                Is the reader an "Angel...whose works are only Analytics," or an "Angel, who is now
                become a Devil," reading in the "infernal or diabolical sense" (<i>MHH</i> 6, 7, 20,
                24, E 35, 42, 44)? Does the reader participate in or resist the creative process
                embodied in the book?</p>

            <p>In 1795, Blake produced a deluxe set of the books on large paper, possibly to display
                at the shop of his friend and sometimes employer, the publisher Joseph Johnson.
                Blake had by this time printed and colored with Mrs. Blake about 125 copies of his
                illuminated books in small editions very much on his own terms: "No Subscriptions
                for the numerous great works now in hand are asked, for none are wanted; but the
                Author will produce his works, and offer them to sale at a fair price" (Prospectus,
                E 693). Except for <i>Songs</i>, most copies of illuminated books executed by 1795
                were also printed by 1795: fourteen of the sixteen extant copies of <i>Thel</i>;
                seven of the nine copies of <i>Marriage</i>; fourteen of seventeen copies of
                    <i>Visions</i>, twelve of fourteen copies of <i>America</i>; eight of the nine
                copies of <i>Europe</i>; seven of the eight copies of <i>Urizen</i>; unique copies
                of <i>The Book of Los</i> and <i>Ahania</i>, and the six copies of <i>The Song of
                    Los</i>.</p>

            <p>For years he relied on stock, which, for <i>Songs</i>, his most popular work, lasted
                till around 1802, when he reprinted a few copies of <i>Innocence</i> and
                    <i>Experience</i>, adding a few more in 1804 or 1805. One from the latter
                printing (Q) he sold to the Rev. Joseph Thomas, who paid "ten guineas" (&#163;10, 10
                shillings)&#8212;the price Blake feared in 1827 he could "scarce expect to get from a
                Stranger"&#8212;as a way of giving this proud artist a monetary gift. This was far more
                than Blake had ever received for an illuminated book, and "for such a sum" he "could
                hardly do enough, finishing the plates like miniatures" (Gilchrist, I.124). Indeed,
                Blake's "fair price" for the <i>Songs</i> was originally 6 shillings, 6 pence
                (Prospectus, E 693). Initially, all his books were sold in shillings, not pounds,
                priced as poetry rather than as colored prints or small paintings. The following
                year, in 1806, when Butts requested a copy, Blake's stock of <i>Songs</i> was again
                depleted, so he created copy E by salvaging poorly printed impressions from various
                1789, 1794, and 1795 printings of <i>Innocence</i> and <i>Experience</i> still in
                the studio, recoloring them and strengthening text and designs in pen and ink. A lot
                of work but easier than making ink and colors, preparing paper and press, inking
                plates and printing, which were not worth doing for just one copy of one book&#8212;or, at
                that time, even for a complete set of books.</p>

            <p>In December 1808, Cumberland wrote on behalf of a friend who was so charmed with
                Blake's "incomparable etchings...that he requested...a compleat Set of all you have
                published in the way of <i>Books</i> coloured as mine are." If none were "to be
                had," he was "willing to wait your own time in order to have them as those of mine
                are" (<i>BR</i> 211). Blake refused this generous offer, fearing to disrupt his
                present course of "Designing &#38; Painting": I am very much obliged by your kind
                ardour in my cause &#38; should immediately Engage in reviving my former pursuits of
                printing if I had not now so long been turned out of the old channel into a new one
                that it is impossible for me to return to it without destroying my present course
                New Vanities or rather new pleasures occupy my thoughts New profits seem to arise
                before me so tempting that I have already involved myself in engagements that
                preclude all possibility of promising any thing...my time...in future must alone be
                devoted to Designing &#38; Painting. (letter of 19 December 1808, E 769-70) Blake
                was working on his 1809 exhibition, which netted a scurrilous review but no profits.
                For the next decade, with his stock of books depleted, Blake continued to work
                primarily as a painter and engraver, executing temperas (what he called "fresco"),
                illustrating Milton's major poems, and engraving designs after Flaxman. He finished
                his <i>Milton</i>, printing three copies about 1811, and he continued to etch plates
                for <i>Jerusalem</i>&#8212;though, according to Cumberland, he had already etched "60
                Plates of a new Prophecy" by summer 1807 (<i>BR</i> 187).</p>

            <p>Only fourteen copies of four books (<i>Innocence</i>, <i>Experience</i>,
                    <i>America</i>, and <i>Milton</i>) were produced between ca. 1796 and 1818,
                which means that most illuminated books lay untouched for over twenty years. Blake
                did not replenish his stock until around 1818, motivated possibly by Linnell, whom
                he met that summer, and/or an inquiry about the books from Dawson Turner. He sent
                Turner a list of eight books (<i>Innocence</i> and <i>Experience</i> were still
                listed separately) and "12 Large Prints" that he was willing to reprint and their
                prices, telling him "that any Person wishing to have any or all of them should send
                me their Order to Print them on the above terms &#38; I will take care that they
                shall be done at least as well as any I have yet Produced" (letter of 9 June 1818, E
                771). For the first time since 1795, he printed copies of <i>Thel</i> (N, O),
                    <i>Marriage</i> (G), <i>Visions</i> (N, O, P), and <i>Urizen</i> (G), along with
                    <i>Milton</i> (D) and <i>Songs</i> (U, T), all in the same orange-red ink,
                paper, and coloring style. Of these, only <i>Marriage</i>, which he did not include
                in the list for Turner, and <i>Songs</i> would he print again.<sup><a class="footnote">note 8<span>There are no surviving post-1795 copies of
    <i>All Religions</i>, <i>No Natural
    Religion</i>, <i>Book of Los</i>, <i>Ahania</i>, or <i>Song of Los</i>.</span></a></sup> Nor did he
                list <i>Jerusalem</i>, which was still in progress and not printed till c. 1820, in
                three copies in black ink, one of which Linnell purchased. He did list
                    <i>America</i> and <i>Europe</i>, but did not print them till 1821, when he
                produced matching copies (O and K, respectively) for Linnell and began printing and
                coloring <i>Jerusalem</i> copy E in the same style.</p>

            <p>The books he offered to Cumberland in 1827 were the same as those he had offered
                Turner (minus <i>Milton</i> and with <i>Innocence</i> and <i>Experience</i>
                combined), and the prices were &#163;1-2 higher. Though nothing on the list was printed,
                he was&#8212;"consistent with [his] other Work"&#8212;printing copies of <i>Songs</i> and
                    <i>Marriage</i> (again, conspicuously missing from his list), and ended his days
                printing a copy of <i>Jerusalem</i>. When he said he had "none remaining of all that
                [he] had Printed," he meant it. He had even sold his personal copies: Songs copy R
                (the model for the plate order of the last seven copies), printed c. 1795, to
                Linnell in 1819, for &#163;1 19sh. 6d. (more than &#163;4 less than he offered <i>Songs</i> to
                Turner) and <i>Marriage</i> copy H, printed in 1790, to Linnell in 1821, for &#163;2 2sh.
                (less than half the then price of <i>Urizen</i>&#8212;which was etched on its versos). As
                with <i>Songs</i> copy E, he reworked both books before selling them. For
                    <i>Songs</i> copy R, he added wide frames around each image and strengthened the
                coloring. For <i>Marriage</i> copy H, initially uncolored but printed in various
                red, olive, and green inks on both sides of the leaves, Blake elaborately colored
                the pages, adding gold leaf and, what is most unusual, going over the texts in
                various colored inks, word by word.</p>

            <p>When he died, Blake had the only complete colored copy of <i>Jerusalem</i> (E), which
                he feared would not find "a Customer," and <i>Songs</i> copy W. His wife inherited
                both but could sell only the Songs. All of Blake's illuminated plates, prints,
                drawings, and manuscripts ended up in the hands of Frederick Tatham, one of the
                young artists who gathered around Blake in the last years of his life. In the 1830s,
                Tatham printed uncolored copies of <i>Songs</i>, <i>America</i>, <i>Europe</i>, and
                    <i>Jerusalem</i> from Blake's plates. The plates disappeared while in Tatham's
                possession, reputedly sold for scrap metal (BR 417n3).</p>

                <b name="CONC" id="CONC">9. Conclusion</b></h2>
            <p>From the perspective of book publishing, Blake's illuminated books were produced as
                fine "limited editions." They were not invented to secure financial independence,
                and they didn't. And though Blake stated that his method cut production costs
                (primarily by his not paying for labor, manuscript, or design), it was a labor
                intensive, and not cost effective, means of production, mostly underwritten by his
                commercial work. Printing relief-etched plates was not difficult, but slow compared
                to printing books in the standard way. Considering how few copies Blake could
                produce during the "run," we can see why he felt that he was "never...able to
                produce a Sufficient number for a general Sale by means of a regular Publisher," and
                why the books proved "unprofitable enough to [him] tho Expensive to the Buyer." But
                from the perspective of an artist accustomed to producing unique works, illuminated
                books provided wider audiences and greater opportunities to make his reputation,
                which he also admitted to Turner: "The Few I have Printed and Sold are sufficient to
                have gained me great reputation as an Artist which was the chief thing Intended." He
                also insisted, though, referring to the Large and Small Books of Designs, that
                printing illuminated plates "without the Writing" was at "the Loss of some of the
                best things For they when Printed perfect accompany Poetical Personifications &#38;
                Acts without which Poems they never could have been Executed" (letter of 9 June
                1818, E 771).</p>

            <p>Looking back from the last year of his life, Blake could see the great contrast
                between his early and late illuminated books. The first six years of production
                progressed through a series of three formats: leaves printed on both sides and
                lightly washed (1789-93), color printing (1794-95), and single-sided printing with
                borders and richer coloring (c. 1795). After 1795, the format remained the same,
                though the coloring style continued to become more elaborate. Late practice differed
                from early in that far fewer copies per book were produced, various titles were
                produced in the same session, and printing sessions appear to have been motivated by
                at least one commission, which made printing other titles viable. Late copies cost
                far more than early ones. The dramatic increase in price reflects a change in
                Blake's idea of the book&#8212;from books of poems to series of hand-colored prints, from
                prints as pages to prints as paintings. The latter demanded more from him and the
                reader, but, early or late, his books always had the power to illuminate, to open
                eyes and convert "angels" into "devils." The apocalyptic role of his "infernal
                method" was always clear: "The whole creation will be consumed, and appear infinite.
                and holy...by an improvement of sensual enjoyment" (<i>MHH</i> 14, E 39)&#8212;and with
                that, "the Author is sure of his reward" (Prospectus, E 692).</p>
