      <!--<h2 class="title">William Blake Archive Update</h2>-->
      <p>August 1, 1997</p>
      
      
      <p>The editors of the William Blake Archive are pleased to announce that
        <cite>The Book of Thel</cite>, copy F, is now online in searchable form. This
        may seem a modest achievement, given that this is one of Blake's shorter
        works, and that its eight plates (with enlargements and accompanying
        transcriptions) have already been available on this site since November of
        1996. In fact, however, this copy of <cite>The Book of Thel</cite> is a
        prototype for all future works to be added to the Archive (both illuminated
        books and other materials), and its appearance reflects the architecture and
        objectives of the Archive as they have taken shape over many months of
        development, testing, and refinement.</p>
      
      
      <p>Unlike its previous version, and unlike the other illuminated books
        currently available in the Archive, this copy of <cite>Thel</cite> has been
        tagged using SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language). SGML tagging offers
        the Archive's users the opportunity to perform sophisticated searches, either
        on the text of the plates, or, more remarkably, on the <i>content of their
          illustrations</i>. Search results are retrieved and presented using DynaWeb,
        a product of the Inso Corporation. The text and image searching enabled by
        DynaWeb and the underlying SGML tagging is a powerful demonstration of the
        potential of electronic resources in the humanities.</p>
      
      
      <p>However, there's more. Users with Java-capable browsers can now make use
        of Inote, Java-based software developed at the Institute for Advanced
        Technology in the Humanities, to assist them in their study of the Archive's
        visual materials. Users may employ Inote to examine editorial annotations of
        a given image independently of a search, or else, following a successful
        image search, Inote may be used to open the image, zoomed to the specific
        area containing the object of the search, together with the relevant
        editorial commentary. This is IATH's first public implementation of Inote,
        and its release marks a major advance for image-based electronic editing.</p>
      
      
      <p>Users with Java-capable browsers can also take advantage of a second,
        equally innovative Java program developed at IATH, the ImageSizer. This is a
        feature that allows one to view Blake's plates and images at their true size,
        reproducing the object's actual physical dimensions on the screen, regardless
        of the resolution of a particular monitor; indeed, users can calibrate this
        feature to consistently display the Archive's images at whatever proportions
        they may wish.</p>
      
      
      <p>Finally, the Archive's selective bibliography of criticism, reference
        materials, and standard editions, with about 500 entries, is now available.
        We hope to have the bibliography searchable by the end of the summer. We also
        hope to have David V. Erdman's <cite>Complete Poetry and Prose of William
          Blake</cite> online and searchable by that same time.</p>
      
      
      <p>In the coming weeks and months we will turn our attention to placing other
        illuminated books online in searchable form, following on the model of
        <cite>The Book of Thel</cite>, copy F. We will begin with the other copies of
        <cite>Thel</cite> (copies H and O), as well as copies of <cite>Visions of the
          Daughters of Albion</cite> (copies C and J) now publicly available only in
        HTML -- thus lacking any of the capabilities described above. We will then
        move on to other books: <cite>All Religions are One</cite> (copy A),
        <cite>There is No Natural Religion</cite> (copies C and L), <cite>The
          Marriage of Heaven and Hell</cite> (copy D), <cite>America</cite> (copy E),
        <cite>Europe</cite> (copies B and E), <cite>The Song of Los</cite> (copies A
        and B), <cite>The Book of Urizen</cite> (copy G), <cite>Songs of Innocence
          and of Experience</cite> (copy Z), <cite>The Book of Ahania</cite> (copy A),
        and <cite>The Book of Los</cite> (copy A).</p>
