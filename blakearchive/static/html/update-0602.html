      <!--<h2 class="title">William Blake Archive Update</h2>-->
      <p>27 June 2002</p>
      
      
      <p>The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of
        Blake's twelve water-color illustrations to John Milton's poems "L'Allegro"
        and "Il Penseroso," now in the Pierpont Morgan Library, New York. These
        splendid designs are published in our new Preview mode, one that provides all
        the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (our image
        annotation program). Each design is accompanied by a manuscript leaf that
        includes a quotation of the lines illustrated and brief interpretive comments
        by Blake. These manuscript leaves are also reproduced here in sequence
        following each design.</p>
      
      
      <p>Produced for Blake's chief patron, Thomas Butts, c. 1816-20, the
        "L'Allegro" and "Il Penseroso" illustrations exhibit the delicacy and
        refinement typical of Blake's late water-color style. Milton's contrasting
        companion poems gave Blake yet another opportunity to explore his own sense
        of contrariety, much as he did earlier in his career in <i>Songs of Innocence
          and of Experience</i>. Through the careful selection of passages to
        illustrate, Blake also emphasizes the visionary and transformative moments in
        Milton's poems.</p>
      
      
      <p>At present the Archive contains 45 copies of 18 of Blake's 19 illuminated
        books (all fully searchable); the Thomas Butts set of Blake's water colors
        illustrating the Book of Job, also in the Pierpont Morgan Library; and now
        the first of several series of Milton illustrations that we will be adding in
        Preview. In the near future we expect to release more drawings and prints in
        Preview, a much-anticipated electronic edition of <i>Jerusalem</i> copy E,
        and further supplementary materials, including a biography and glossary.</p>
      
      
      <p>As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access
        restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible
        through the continuing support of the Institute for Advanced Technology in
        the Humanities at the University of Virginia, by a major grant from the
        Preservation and Access Division of the National Endowment for the
        Humanities, by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and by the
        cooperation of the international array of libraries and museums that have
        generously given us permission to reproduce works from their collections in
        the Archive.</p>
