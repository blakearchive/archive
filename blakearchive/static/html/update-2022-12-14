The William Blake Archive is pleased to present four of Blake’s most complex designs in our
Works in Preview wing, an environment that enables viewers to enlarge images many times their
true size to clarify details obscured in other reproductions. Works in Preview can be accessed
through the drop-down at the upper right of the Archive’s home page.
</p>
<p>
The four works are <a href="preview/but673" target="_blank"><i>An Allegory of the Spiritual Condition of Man</i></a>, pen and tempera on canvas,
1811, from the Fitzwilliam Museum; <a href="preview/but770" target="_blank"><i>Epitome of James Hervey’s “Meditations Among the
Tombs,”</i></a> pen and watercolor, c. 1820, from Tate Britain; <a href="preview/but803" target="_blank"><i>The Sea of Time and Space</i></a>, pen,
watercolor, and gouache, dated 1821, from The National Trust, Arlington Court, Devon; and <a href="preview/but811" target="_blank"><i>The
Characters in Spenser’s “Faerie Queene,”</i></a> pen and watercolor on muslin, mounted on panel, c.
1825, from Petworth House, Sussex.
</p>
<p>
At approximately 5 x 4 feet, <i>The Spiritual Condition of Man</i> is Blake’s largest extant painting. It
has been specially photographed at very high resolution for this presentation to provide
unprecedented detail. The twelve vignettes along the sides—from top left down and up to top
right, with landscapes, buildings, and figures now clearly visible—present humanity’s progress
from creation to redemption. <i>Hervey’s Meditations</i> is smaller but more densely packed with
numerous figures floating up and down the sides in the style of the <a href="staticpage/update?p=update-2021-06-28" target="_blank">Last Judgment designs</a>, only
here the figures and actions are identified in gold letters. <i>The Sea of Time and Space</i> was
discovered in a cupboard in Arlington Court in 1947 and has been the subject of debate ever
since. <i>Spenser’s “Faerie Queene”</i> is the size and in the panoramic format of <a href="preview/but653" target="_blank"><i>Sir Jeffery Chaucer
and the Nine and Twenty Pilgrims</i></a> on their Journey to Canterbury of 1808, which is the subject
of a <a href="exhibit/canterburypilgrims" target="_blank">digital exhibition</a> and is also in Works in Preview.

In Preview mode, viewers zoom in or out by using the Preview window’s “plus” or “minus”
buttons, by moving two fingers up or down on the track pad, or by using a mouse’s wheel;
viewers move an image by clicking and dragging. Images can also be examined in Full Screen
mode, which provides the largest display and is ideal for external monitors. Viewers return to the
whole design as initially displayed by clicking Home; in Full Screen mode, they return by
clicking Exit Full Screen. Both viewing modes are accompanied by a slider that lightens and
darkens the image, enabling users to see details long obscured by darkened paints and varnishes.
The medium, size, date, provenance, and location of each design is given in the Work
Information link under the image; also accompanying each design are Editors’ Notes and a link
to the Lightbox, where images can be moved, rotated, resized, and cropped. For a tutorial on
viewing Works in Preview, see our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGrzrwexIiI" target="_blank">video</a>.
