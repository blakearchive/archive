<i>It is with heavy hearts that the Blake Archive shares the news of the passing of founding editor <a targe="_blank" href="https://www.rochester.edu/newscenter/morris-eaves-english-professor-who-breathed-new-life-into-william-blake-scholarship-remembered-595342/">Morris Eaves</a> on Sunday, February 25. His many and long-standing contributions to Blake and Romantic studies, and to the worlds of graphic design, visual arts, and digital humanities were an inspiration to us all. We could not have asked for a more brilliant, generous, and affable colleague. He will be deeply missed. We carry on the work that he made possible for nearly thirty years.</i>

The William Blake Archive is pleased to present five of Blake's tempera paintings in our Works in Preview wing, an environment that enables viewers to enlarge images many times their true size to clarify details obscured in other reproductions. Works in Preview can be accessed through the drop-down at the upper right of the Archive's home page.

The five works are <a href="preview/but667" target="_blank"><i>Adam Naming the Beasts</i></a> and <a href="preview/but668" target="_blank"><i>Eve Naming the Birds</i></a>, both pen and tempera on canvas, 1810, from Pollok House, Glasgow; <a href="preview/but669" target="_blank"><i>The Virgin and Child in Egypt</i></a>, tempera on canvas, 1810, from the Victoria and Albert Museum; <a href="preview/but670" target="_blank"><i>Christ Blessing</i></a>, tempera on canvas, 1810, Fogg Art Museum, Harvard University; and <a href="preview/but674" target="_blank"><i>The Virgin and Child ("The Black Madonna")</i></a>, tempera and gold on panel, c. 1810–1820, Yale Center for British Art. The first four paintings form a group; they are the same size (about 75 x 62 cm.), format (the figures are half length portraits with similar hand positions), and in the same medium and date. All four were painted for Blake's patron Thomas Butts in a medium of Blake's invention, which he called "fresco." <i>Adam Naming the Beasts</i> and <i>The Virgin and Child in Egypt</i> are signed "Fresco by Will<sup>m</sup> Blake 1810" on the right and left trees respectively, but the signature of the former is partly illegible and entirely illegible in the latter. <i>The Virgin and Child ("The Black Madonna")</i> is inscribed "Freso [sic] 1825 Blake" lower right. Butlin 674 points out that the handling of the tempera medium may suggest an earlier date, probably between 1810 and 1820, and that the inscription may be a later addition, possibly by someone other than Blake. The lettering is not characteristic of Blake's hand. Butlin suggests that the date may be a mistaken restoration or post-dating by Blake.

In Preview mode, viewers zoom in or out by using the Preview window’s "plus" or "minus" buttons, by moving two fingers up or down on the track pad, or by using a mouse's wheel; viewers move an image by clicking and dragging. Images can also be examined in Full Screen mode, which provides the largest display and is ideal for external monitors. Viewers return to the whole design as initially displayed by clicking Home; in Full Screen mode, they return by clicking Exit Full Screen. Both viewing modes are accompanied by a slider that lightens and darkens the image, enabling users to see details long obscured by darkened paints and varnishes. The medium, size, date, provenance, and location of each design are given in the Work Information link under the image; also accompanying each design are Editors' Notes and a link to the Lightbox, where images can be moved, rotated, resized, and cropped. For a tutorial on viewing Works in Preview, see our <a targe="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGrzrwexIiI">video</a>.
