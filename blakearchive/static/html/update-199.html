      <p>The editors of the William Blake Archive are pleased to announce the
        opening of a major new wing of the site, devoted to documentation and
        supplementary materials "<a href="./about">About the Archive</a>." Available
        as the first entry on our main table of contents page, the "About the
        Archive" materials consist of:</p>
      
      
      <br/><br/>

        <li>A reference page listing <a href="./about/articles/">articles</a> by
          members of the project team, as well as reviews and notices of the Archive
          by others;
          
          <br/><br/>
        </li>
        
        
        <li>An updated and expanded version of the article-length <a href="./about/plan/">Plan of the Archive</a>,
          providing additional detail about our intentions with regard to Blake's
          non-illuminated works.

          Technology in the Humanities</a>, and a link to our extensive <a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/help/help.html" target="help">Help</a>
        documentation. In addition, we will shortly be adding a Tour of the Archive
        to these materials (combining textual narration, graphical screenshots, and
        suggestions as to how to use the Archive). We will announce the Tour in a
        separate update when it is available.</p>
      
      
      <p>We would also like to take this opportunity to announce the Archive's
        recently convened Advisory Board and to thank those who have agreed to
        serve:<br/></p>

      <p>We have an ambitious publication schedule planned for the spring, focused
        on adding additional copies of the illuminated works already available in the
        Archive. In the immediate future we plan to publish the <i>Songs of Innocence
          and of Experience</i> (copies C, F, and L) and <i>The Marriage of Heaven and
            Hell</i> (copies C and F), followed by multiple copies of <i>The Book of
              Urizen</i>, <i>America: A Prophecy</i>, and <i>Europe: A Prophecy</i>, <i>The
                Book of Thel</i>, and <i>Visions of the Daughters of Albion</i> as well as
        further copies of the separate and combined <i>Songs</i> and the
        <i>Marriage</i>. We hope to follow these works with <i>Jerusalem</i> copy E
        by the summer, thus completing the illuminated canon. This spring we will
        also be releasing the electronic Erdman edition in beta form and publishing
        detailed lists documenting the complete contents of the various U.S. and U.K.
        Blake collections (now nine of them) contributing works to the Archive.</p>
