    In 2014 the William Blake Archive added a new wing devoted to searchable HTML and PDF editions of back issues of <i>Blake/An Illustrated Quarterly</i>, beginning with issues from the years 2000-2009. In 2015 we added the forty issues from 1990 to 2000 and five issues published since 2010.   
                <p>
The Archive is now pleased to announce the publication of the quarterly’s forty issues from 1980 to 1990.
<p>
    These are accessible via the second entry on the home page, just below “Works in the Archive.” The HTML versions are re-implemented with several new features. Whenever possible, they replace the original monochrome halftones with full-color images—individually color corrected to Archive standards, and linked to the Archive images—and texts that have been meticulously corrected for typographical errors. The PDF versions, on the other hand, retain the original features of the quarterly, page for page.  
<p>   
    This is the latest installment of the Archive’s ongoing project of making freely available and fully searchable over four decades of the journal, thus making public some of the most important scholarly work done in Blake studies over the past half-century. Issues published within five years of the current issue will remain available only to those who subscribe to the <a href="https://blake.lib.rochester.edu/blakeojs/index.php/blake" target="blank">journal</a>.
    <p>
            As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with the University of Rochester, the continuing support of the Library of Congress, and the cooperation of the international array of libraries and museums that have generously given us permission to reproduce works from their collections in the Archive.
