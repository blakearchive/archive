The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the republication of our Blake <a href="exhibit/biography" target="_blank">Biography</a> and
essay on <a href="exhibit/illuminatedprinting" target="_blank">Illuminated Printing</a> as digital exhibitions, an ideal form for such extensively illustrated
works. They join our recently published first installment in this new wing, the multi-gallery
presentation of Blake’s painting and engraving of <a href="exhibit/canterburypilgrims" target="_blank">Geoffrey Chaucer’s Canterbury pilgrims</a>. They
can be accessed through our <a href="staticpage/biography" target="_blank">About Blake</a> section or Archive Exhibitions, lower left and upper
right, respectively, on the Archive’s home page.
</p>
<p>
The Biography, written by Denise Vultee in collaboration with the editors, was first published in
2003 in our About Blake section. Its 109 separate reproductions exemplifying the range of
Blake’s artistic accomplishment made it the most generously illustrated Blake biography ever
published. The updated exhibition version retains that distinction, with many of the works by
Blake referenced in the text now linked to images in the Archive. The Biography’s seven
sections—1757-1778 || 1779-1788 || 1789-1792 || 1793-1799 || 1800-1808 || 1809-1818 || 1818-
1827—have been redesigned as galleries. Each gallery contains the same navigational features: text (with links to Archive objects and to images in the gallery space) scrolls vertically in the left frame, while the main right frame—the gallery space—scrolls horizontally through a set of images, each one accompanied by a caption.
</p>
<p>
Illuminated Printing, written by Joseph Viscomi, was first published in <i>The Cambridge
Companion to William Blake</i>, edited by Morris Eaves, 2003. It joined our Biography,
Chronology, and Glossary in the About Blake section in 2004. While the text remains the same,
the digital version has 95 illustrations versus 9 in the printed version. The exhibition version has
been updated to include links to the works by Blake mentioned in the text.
The essay’s eight sections have been redesigned as galleries, with the illustrations accompanied
by detailed captions that enable them to be examined as independent slide shows. The first two
galleries, on engraving and new print technologies, examine the technical and aesthetic contexts
in which illuminated printing was invented. The remaining six galleries demonstrate the stages of
both Blake's relief etching (“illuminated printing”) and conventional intaglio etching according
to the six Chambers in the Printing House in Hell, from Blake's <i>The Marriage of Heaven and
Hell</i>.
</p>
<p>
We are also pleased to announce that Alexander Gourlay’s Chronology of the major events of
Blake's life and works has been updated. First published in <i>The Cambridge Companion to
William Blake</i>, the Chronology has new entries and now includes links to the works by Blake
mentioned in the text.

As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access restrictions and charging
