      <p>8 September 2003</p>
      
      
      <p>The William Blake Archive <!--<www.blakearchive.org>--> is pleased to
        announce three publications that inaugurate a new wing, About Blake:</p>
      
      
      <p>(1) a Blake biography, by Denise Vultee in collaboration with the editors,
        with 109 reproductions that exemplify the range of his artistic
        accomplishment--making it the most generously illustrated Blake biography
        ever published.</p>
      
      
      <p>(2) a glossary of unfamiliar Blake terms from Adona to Zoa, by Alexander
        S. Gourlay.</p>
      
      
      <p>(3) and a chronology of the major events of Blake's life and works.</p>
      
      
      <p>As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access
        restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible
        through the continuing support of the Library of Congress, the Institute for
        Advanced Technology in the Humanities at the University of Virginia, by a
        major grant from the Preservation and Access Division of the National
        Endowment for the Humanities, by the University of North Carolina at Chapel
        Hill, and by the cooperation of the international array of libraries and
        museums that have generously given us permission to reproduce works from
        their collections in the Archive.</p>
