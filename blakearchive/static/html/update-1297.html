      <p>December 5, 1997</p>
      
      
      <p>The editors of the William Blake Archive are pleased to announce that the
        main research and development phase of the project has now been completed. At
        the present moment, the Archive contains three copies of <cite>The Book of
          Thel</cite> (copies F, H, and O) and two copies of <cite>Visions of the
            Daughters of Albion</cite> (copies C and J); all of these works are fully
        searchable for both text and images, and all are supported by the unique
        Inote and ImageSizer applications described in our <a href="all-updates.html">previous updates</a>. At this point we can now move
        rapidly into a full-time production schedule, adding new illuminated books to
        the Archive without pausing to address major technical issues. Because we
        expect that they will be widely used in the classroom, the first books to be
        added -- at or near the start of the spring semester -- will be <cite>The
          Marriage of Heaven and Hell</cite> (copy D) and <cite>Songs of Innocence and
            of Experience</cite> (copy Z). Others will then follow, with the goal of
        making at least one copy of each of Blake's illuminated books available by
        summer. In addition, work continues on the SGML edition of David V. Erdman's
        <cite>Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake</cite>, which we anticipate
        releasing sometime in the spring semester.</p>
      
      
      <p>Those of you who have been following our progress over the past two years
        will understand that we've reached a much-anticipated milestone. Thank you
        for your patience and continued interest in the Blake Archive.</p>
