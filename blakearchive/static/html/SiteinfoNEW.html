                    A hypermedia archive sponsored by the Library of Congress and supported
                    by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. With 
                    past support from the Institute for
                    Advanced Technology in the Humanities at the University of Virginia, the Getty Grant Program, the Paul Mellon Centre for 
                    Studies in British Art, the Preservation and Access Division of the 
                    National Endowment for the Humanities, Sun Microsystems, and Inso Corporation.
                    
                    
                    
                    <h3>Purpose</h3>
                    
                    
                    A free site on the World Wide Web since 1996, the Blake Archive was
                    conceived as an international public resource that would provide
                    unified access to major works of visual and literary art that are
                    highly disparate, widely dispersed, and more and more often severely
                    restricted as a result of their value, rarity, and extreme fragility.
                    A growing number of contributors have given the
                    Archive permission to include thousands of Blake's images and texts
                    without fees. The Archive contains searchable and scalable 
                    electronic editions of copies of Blake's illuminated books in the 
                    context of full, up-to-date bibliographic information about each 
                    image, carefully edited transcriptions of all texts, detailed 
                    descriptions of all images, and extensive bibliographies. 
                    Also included are examples of Blake's other work&mdash;commercial 
                    book illustrations, separate prints, drawings and paintings, 
                    and manuscripts&mdash;as well as a searchable electronic version 
                    of David V. Erdman's <i>Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake</i>, 
                    the standard printed edition for reference.

                    The Blake Archive is best accessed using the latest versions 
                    of Web browsers, and a high-resolution monitor set to gamma
                    1.8 and a white point of 5000K (as these are the settings used in
                    color-correcting the inline and enlarged images in the Archive).

                    <h3>Site Configuration</h3>
                    
                    All significant textual data in the Archive&mdash;Blake's actual poetry
                    and prose, as well as the editors' bibliographic commentary and
                    illustration descriptions&mdash;are encoded using the eXtensible Markup
                    Language (XML). XML is not a programming language; it is a descriptive
                    meta-language used to encode (or "tag") textual data in such a way that
                    it will remain usable even as platforms and file formats change over
                    time. By explicitly describing textual data according to a recognized
                    W3C standard, XML frees the Archive from reliance on the vicissitudes
                    of proprietary software packages.
                    
                    <p>You encounter HTML in our "top-level" pages (such as the Archive home page, project
                      updates, and this document).</p>
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    <p>The Archive is organized hierarchically; at its top level are
                      collections grouped by type, such as illuminated books, commercial
                      book illustrations, drawings and sketches, and so forth. As you work
                      your way down through these menus, your choices become more specific:
                      illuminated books, for example, are indexed by title, and titles are
                      indexed by particular copies of the book; particular copies are then
                      indexed by plate. Plates are presented on what we refer to as an
                      Object View screen, the most basic browsable unit in the Archive,
                      corresponding to a discrete physical artifact such as a single plate
                      in an illuminated book or a drawing or a single manuscript page.</p>
