      <!--<h2 class="title">William Blake Archive Update</h2>-->
      <p>6 August 1999</p>
      
      
      <p>The William Blake Archive http://www.blakearchive.org is pleased to
        announce the publication of new electronic editions of copies B and U of
        Blake's <i>Songs of Innocence</i>.</p>
      
      
      <p>Copies B and U are a study in contrasts, yet both are from the earliest
        printings of this book. Copy B, now in the Rosenwald Collection, Library of
        Congress, was printed with fifteen other copies of <i>Innocence</i> in 1789,
        four of which were later joined with <i>Experience</i> impressions, printed
        in 1794, to form <i>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</i> copies B,
        C--which is in the Archive--D, and E. Unlike many of these early copies of
        <i>Innocence</i>, copy B still consists of all 31 plates originally composed
        and executed for <i>Innocence</i>. Like them, however, it was printed in a
        raw sienna ink on 17 leaves and exemplifies Blake's early printing and
        coloring style. The plates were wiped of their plate borders, the
        illustrations very lightly washed in watercolors, and the texts left
        unwashed. This mode of presentation, along with printing both sides of the
        leaves to create facing pages, emphasized the prints as book pages rather
        than prints or paintings. Good examples of printing and coloring illuminated
        plates to look like minatures can be seen in <i>Songs</i> copy Z, also in the
        Archive.</p>
      
      
      <p><i>Innocence</i> copy U, from the Houghton Library, Harvard University, is
        an excellent example of printing illuminated plates to look like prints. Like
        etchings and engravings, they were printed on one side of the leaf in black
        ink and left uncolored. Copy U, which was printed with untraced copy V, had
        been dated c. 1814, because of some stylistic similarities it shares with
        illuminated works assumed to have been produced around that time. But, in
        fact, copy U is the <i>first</i> copy of <i>Innocence</i> printed. The
        presence of a unique first state for "Infant Joy" proves this sequence; the
        bottom part of the "J" in the title is missing in all extant impressions, but
        here it extends into the flower. Copy U was printed before copy B and all
        other early copies; the ink color, printing style (recto only), and lack of
        hand coloring suggest a date of printing before Blake had developed his
        special ways of producing his illuminated books and instead repeated styles
        and techniques long familiar to him as a commercial engraver.</p>
      
      
      <p>Both electronic editions have newly edited SGML-encoded texts and new
        images scanned and color-corrected from first-generation 4x5" transparencies;
        they are each fully searchable for both text and images and supported by the
        Inote and ImageSizer applications described in our previous updates.</p>
      
      
      <p>With the publication of these two titles, the Archive now contains 35
        copies of 18 separate books, including at least one copy of every one of
        Blake's works in illuminated printing except the 100 plates of
        <i>Jerusalem</i> (forthcoming).</p>
