      <!--<h2 class="title">William Blake Archive Update</h2>-->
      <p>15 March 2004</p>
      
      
      <p>The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of the
        electronic edition of <i>America a Prophecy</i> copy M. One of 14 extant
        copies, and one of only four that are colored, copy M was printed c. 1807.
        Now in the Yale Center for British Art, it joins copies A, E, and O in the
        Archive and will be joined by copies F and H in the near future.
        <i>America</i> is dated 1793 on its title plate, and the first ten copies
        were printed that year followed in 1795 by two more copies. Copies E (1793)
        and A (1795) are from these two printing sessions. Copy O was the last to be
        printed, c. 1818. With the addition of copy M, the printing history of
        <i>America</i> is fully represented in the Archive. Copy M, however, is an
        oddity, for it was uniquely printed with no other works during a period when
        Blake appears to have been generally inactive in the printing of his
        illuminated books. It is the only illuminated book printed on Hayes &amp;
        Wise 1799 paper and with most of its plates printed in blue ink. It appears
        to have been printed while Blake was proofing various plates from the first
        two chapters of <i>Jerusalem</i>, some of which are also in blue ink. A few
        of these proofs will enter the Archive in the near future.</p>
      
      
      <p>As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access
        restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible
        through the continuing support of the Library of Congress, the Institute for
        Advanced Technology in the Humanities at the University of Virginia, by a
        major grant from the Preservation and Access Division of the National
        Endowment for the Humanities, by the University of North Carolina at Chapel
        Hill, and by the cooperation of the international array of libraries and
        museums that have generously given us permission to reproduce works from
        their collections in the Archive.</p>
