Water Color Drawings Illustrating the Bible,wc,c. 1780-1824,biblicalwc.jpg,,biblicalwc,"<p>The Bible had an enormous influence on Blake's work as both artist and poet.  Among his many and complex responses to that text are water color drawings.  These range throughout most of Blake's career, beginning with early works such as <i>Abraham and Isaac</i>, datable to c. 1780, and continuing to <i>Moses Placed in the Ark of the Bulrushes</i> of c. 1824.  The main group of biblical water colors is a sequence of about 80 works of similar size painted for Thomas Butts between c. 1800 and c. 1806.  The Old Testament subjects emphasize interactions, both revelatory and punishing, between the human and the divine.  New Testament subjects naturally center on the life of Christ.  Most of the works based on books following the four Gospels, such as <i>The Conversion of Saul</i>, picture moments of revelation.  The water colors painted for Butts include some of Blake's greatest works in that medium, including <i>The Great Red Dragon and the Woman Clothed with the Sun</i> and at least seven other examples of the apocalyptic sublime based on the Book of Revelation.</p><p>  The water colors are arranged here according to the order in Martin Butlin's <i>The Paintings and Drawings of William Blake</i>, a catalogue raisonn&eacute; and standard reference work on Blake.  At some point after 1846, many of the water colors painted for Butts were mounted on backing mats inscribed in handsome script with appropriate passages from the Bible.  Many of these mats have been removed and discarded, but a few of those still extant, such as the mat for <i>Joseph and Potiphar's Wife</i>, have been included under ""Related Works in the Archive"" on the pull-down menu.</p>",biblicalwc.info.xml,1,"but146.1,but435.1,but436.1,but438.1,but439.1,but440.1,but441.1,but442.1,but445.1,but446.1,but447.1,but448.1,but449.1,but450.1,but452.1,but453.1,but455.1,but457.1,but458.1,but461.1,but462.1,but463.1,but466.1,but467.1,but468.1,but469.1,but470.1,but472.1,but473.1,but475.1,but476.1,but478.1,but480.1,but482.1,but484.1,but485.1,but486.1,but488.1,but489.1,but494.1,but495.1,but496.1,but497.1,but498.1,but499.1,but500.1,but501.1,but502.1,but503.1,but504.1,but505.1,but506.1,but507.1,but511.1,but512.1,but515.1,but517.1,but518.1,but519.1,but520.1,but521.1,but522.1,but523.1,but524.1,but525.1"
Letters,ltr,"1800-1805, 1825-27",letters.jpg,,letters,"<p>Letters may be less often treasured and transmitted from generation to generation than works of art. Blake's surviving correspondence begins rather late in his career, in October 1791, the month before he turned 34, when he drops a short note to architect-editor Willey Reveley ""to embrace the offer of engraving such beautiful things""&mdash;drawings by William Pars for the third volume of James Stuart and Nicholas Revett's <i>Antiquities of Athens</i>, 1794&mdash;&amp; will do what he can by the end of January [1792]."" He writes his last letter, as far as we know, the month before his death at age 69 in August 1827&mdash;just three sentences to the friend and benefactor of his final decade, artist John Linnell, to thank him for sending ten pounds and to indicate that his ""journey to Hampstead on Sunday brought on a relapse . . . . however I am upon the mending hand to day &amp; hope soon to look as I did for I have been yellow accompanied by all the old Symptoms.""</p><p>About ninety of Blake's letters survive, an unknown fraction of the total. Several&mdash;ten in the present group of 54&mdash;are known only from partial and full transcriptions in the second, expanded, edition of Alexander Gilchrist's <span style=""font-style:italic"">Life of William Blake</span> (1880). Blake traveled seldom and not very far, and he was little known beyond a small circle of British contemporaries, most of them in London. His circle of correspondents was narrow and the geographical circuit small. Only three correspondents&mdash;friends and patrons Thomas Butts, William Hayley, and John Linnell&mdash;occasion most of the letters. There are none addressed to such erstwhile friends and associates as Thomas Stothard, Joseph Johnson, and Henry Fuseli. No surviving letter traveled outside of England, and most letters simply traveled across town. But Blake's modest body of correspondence comprises an absorbing, revealing miscellany of simple business receipts, accounts, and reports on work in progress alongside friendly and not so friendly exchanges on matters of practical and intellectual substance. Occasionally they burst out into visions that amalgamate, in a characteristic Blakean vein, homely details, intensely energized prose, and inspired poetry.</p><p>Whether or not we concur with Geoffrey Keynes's estimation of Blake's best letters as worthy of ""an honoured place in any anthology of letters by men of genius"" (<i>Letters</i>, page xix), they are indispensable in preserving facts and contexts for his life and work that would be otherwise unknown and in showing him shift pragmatically from role to role in a very natural&mdash;and human&mdash;way, exposing facets of character and personality not always so apparent in his art. If he can be a self-advertising seeker of custom and patronage, he can also be a defensively boastful brother; a maker of excuses; an optimistic, excited participant; a miserable urban artisan trapped in the country, seeking comfort from London friends and patrons; a repatriated but terrified Londoner facing trial on charges of sedition stemming from a confrontation in the provinces&mdash;and now desperately dependent on Thomas Hayley, the Felpham patron whom he had come to resent if not despise.</p> <p>The letters feel closer to the externalities of everyday life than any other work from Blake's hand, and some start out to be one very ordinary thing and end up being another quite extraordinary thing. Blake's resistance to uniformity shows up in the range of expression of his most compelling letters&mdash;those grounded in everyday transactions but punctuated by bursts of artistic expression and intense thought colored by a volatile rainbow of anxiety, relief, stubborn resentment, pride, fury, disappointment, terror, frustration, hope, happiness, and even joy. Most of the letters have plain utilitarian purposes. Blake is not an artist-thinker in correspondence with an international circle; nonetheless, Blake being Blake, he seldom puts pen to paper without interesting consequences for readers, even when the primary aim is perfectly ordinary.</p> <p>G. E. Bentley, Jr., has created a list of letters that Blake may have written but are absent from the present record. See ""William Blake and His Circle: A Checklist of Publications and Discoveries in 2011,"" <i>Blake/An Illustrated Quarterly</i> 46:1 (summer 2012).

"Sketches for Robert Blair's ""The Grave""",penc,6/1/1805,gravepd.jpg,,gravepd,"<p>In October 1805, Blake was commissioned by the engraver and would-be publisher Robert H. Cromek to prepare forty drawings illustrating Robert Blair's <i>The Grave</i>, a popular ""Graveyard"" school poem first published in 1743. Cromek planned to select twenty of these designs for a de luxe edition of the poem. In Cromek's first prospectus of November 1805, Blake is named as both the designer and engraver of fifteen designs. Blake etched one image, ""Deaths Door,"" in white-line, but Cromek rejected it. The dark power of the white-line print appeals to modern tastes, but was far from fashionable in the early nineteenth century.  In a second prospectus, also of November 1805, Cromek announced that Louis Schiavonetti would engrave twelve designs for the new edition. Blake had lost the potentially lucrative commission to engrave his own designs; his relationship with Cromek descended into anger and argument.  In spite of their disagreement, Cromek included a portrait of Blake as a frontispiece to the volume, published in 1808. Cromek promoted the book aggressively and the illustrations to <i>The Grave</i> became Blake's best known work through much of the nineteenth century.</p><p>Blake's first drafts of illustrations for <i>The Grave</i> include a number of pencil sketches.  Most are rough first thoughts on paper; some were developed into finished water colors and engraved by Schiavonetti, but other designs were not further developed.  We present here a selection of these pencil sketches.  Selections of Blake's monochrome wash drawings and preliminary water colors for <i>The Grave</i> are also available in the Archive under their respective genre headings.</p><p>For further information on Blake's illustrations to <i>The Grave</i>, see Drawings and Paintings, Water Color Drawings, <a href=""&#xA;/blake/work/butwba10"">Illustrations to Robert Blair's <i>The Grave</i></a>; and Commercial Book Illustrations, Designed by Blake and Engraved by Other Engravers, <a href=""&#xA;/blake/work/bb435"">Robert Blair, <i>The Grave</i></a>.</p>",gravepd.info.xml,1,"but614r.1,but614v.1,but619.1,but621r.1,but623.1,but624r.1,but624v.1,but625.1,but629.1"
Paintings Illustrating the Bible,paint,c. 1799-1803,biblicaltemperas.jpg,,biblicaltemperas,"<p>The Bible had an enormous influence on Blake's work as both artist and poet.  Among his many and complex responses to that text is a group of paintings he created for his patron Thomas Butts, beginning in 1799.  Most were executed in that year and the next, but at least three were probably completed while Blake was in Felpham, 1802 and 1803.  Fifty-three of these ""cabinet paintings"" (as small works of this type were called in Blake's time) have been recorded.  Only thirty are now traceable, seven based on the Old Testament and the remainder on the New.</p><p>The medium of these paintings, now generally called ""tempera,"" is water-based with a glue and/or gum binder.  Blake applied his pigments in multiple layers, including intervening applications of transparent glue or gum.  Outlines were often reinforced with black ink and the finished compositions glazed with glue.  Blake was probably trying to create jewel-like paintings; in his <i>Descriptive Catalogue</i> of 1809, he compared them to ""enamels"" and ""precious stones"" (Erdman page 531).  He never used the word ""tempera"" but called his medium ""fresco""&mdash;a term that recalls Renaissance wall paintings&mdash;and claimed that he had invented the new genre of ""portable Fresco"" (<i>Exhibition of Paintings in Fresco</i>, Erdman pages 527), an alternative to paintings in oil.  Most were executed on canvas, but three are on copper and one (<i>The Agony in the Garden</i>) is on tinned iron.</p><p>Unfortunately, Blake's medium was inherently unstable.  The pigment layers expanded and contracted at different rates.  Almost all his temperas of 1799-1803 show considerable surface cracking and other defects; many have been repaired at least once.  Some, such as <i>The Miracle of the Loaves and Fishes</i>, have been over-painted in ways that misrepresent Blake's original work.</p><p>Blake's biblical temperas of 1799-1803 can be divided into two groups according to size.  Most are approximately 27 x 38 cm., but five of the extant paintings measure about 32.5 x 49.5 cm.  The works in the larger size illustrate the life of Christ and may form their own series.  The four paintings of the Evangelists (two extant) may constitute another sub-category. </p><p>Most of the biblical passages illustrated by these paintings are associated with long-standing iconographic conventions.  Blake appears to have been aware of these traditions, probably learned through reproductive engravings.  Blake's <i>Lot and His Daughters</i> is strikingly similar to Rubens' painting of the scene.  Although Matthew 2.14 does not indicate that Joseph, Mary, and Jesus were accompanied by guardian angels and putti in their journey to Egypt, Blake's <i>The Flight into Egypt</i> includes such figures in accord with many representations of the event from the fifteenth through the eighteenth centuries.</p><p>The paintings are arranged here according to the biblical texts illustrated.  Some of the subjects, including <i>The Christ Child Asleep on a Cross</i>, <i>The Body of Christ Borne to the Tomb</i>, and <i>Christ the Mediator</i>, are not based on specific passages but can be associated with events related in the Bible.</p>",biblicaltemperas.info.xml,1,"but379.1,but381.1,but382.1,but387.1,but390.1,but392.1,but394.1,but396.1,but400.1,but401.1,but403.1,but404.1,but406.1,but409.1,but410.1,but411.1,but415.1,but416.1,but417.1,but419.1,but420.1,but424.1,but425.1,but426.1,but429.1"

The Large Color Printed Drawings of 1795 and c. 1805,cprint,1795,cpd.jpg,,cpd,"<p>Blake's twelve large color prints, first designed and executed in 1795, are often considered to be his greatest works as a pictorial artist. Both their sublime imagery and the printmaking technique Blake used to create them evolved out of his illuminated books of 1790-95. Although at least one of the prints, <i>God Judging Adam</i>, shows evidence of having been printed from a copperplate etched in relief, the other eleven appear to have been painted within pen and ink outlines on gessoed millboards (a thick cardboard) and printed onto large sheets of damp wove paper using a rolling press. From such a prepared matrix Blake was often able to print two impressions (a first and second pull) without repainting the matrix, and he finished all impressions in water colors and pen and ink. No more than three impressions of any one of the twelve designs are extant. After printing, each impression was worked up with pen and ink outlining and water colors. For a full technical description of Blake's large color prints and their relation to the illuminated books and <i>Book of Designs</i>, see Joseph Viscomi, <a href=""http://siteslab.unc.edu//viscomi/Annus_Mirabilis/index.html"">Blake's 'Annus Mirabilis': the Productions of 1795,""</a><i>Blake/An Illustrated Quarterly</i> (fall, 2007): 52-83.</p><p>An impression of <i>Elohim Creating Adam</i> (Butlin 290) and an impression of <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> (Butlin 304) may be untraced. There are twenty-nine extant impressions of twelve designs, all produced in at least two printings, c. 1795 and c. 1804-05. It is possible that, c. 1805, Blake added more hand outlining and tinting to some impressions printed in 1795. No design has more than three extant impressions. As with the illuminated books, each impression is different due to variations in color printing and finishing.</p><p>Modern scholars have interpreted the connections among the designs and their iconography, but no interpretation has become definitive. It seems as though the twelve subjects are not a series with a fixed sequence, but rather a group of designs centered upon images of the fallen world. Within that group are a few companion prints, such as <i>Elohim Creating Adam</i> and <i>Satan Exulting over Eve</i>, associated in subject, design, or both. The textual sources for the images range from the Bible to Shakespeare, Milton, and Blake's own poetic mythologies of the mid-1790s.</p><p>The large color prints are widely dispersed. The Archive contains all 29 extant impressions of the twelve designs. Eleven prints are drawn from the Tate Collection, by far the largest single collection; the others are from the British Museum; the Collection of Robert N. Essick; the Fitzwilliam Museum; the J.

Blake's Illustrations of Dante,spb,1826-27,bb448.1.2-1.ps.100.jpg,bb448.1,bb448,"<p>Blake began to compose 102 water color illustrations to Dante's <i>Divine Comedy</i> in the fall of 1824 for his patron John Linnell. From these Blake selected 7 designs to engrave. The choice of subjects, all from the ""Inferno,"" may have been recommended, or at least approved, by Linnell. There may have been plans to engrave more designs, but even these 7 plates were left incomplete at Blake's death in 1827. The copperplates became Linnell's possession, but it was not until 1838 that he had sets printed for sale.</p><p>Like Blake's Job engravings, the Dante plates are pure line engravings without preliminary etching. Although it is difficult to determine Blake's stylistic intentions from unfinished plates, the Dante engravings suggest the influence of Renaissance Italian prints, including the dramatic ""broad manner"" work of Andrea Mantegna, the artist called ""the Dante of his profession"" by Blake's friend George Cumberland.

"Illustrations to Milton's ""Paradise Lost"", The Thomas Set",wc,1807,but529.1.1.wc.100.jpg,but529.1,but529,"<p>The poetry of John Milton was important to Blake as both poet and artist from his earliest years.  As he told John Flaxman in a letter of 12 September 1800, ""Milton lovd me in childhood &amp; shewd me his face"" (Erdman page 707).  Several early drawings, such as the <i>Satan, Sin, and Death</i> of c. 1780 (Butlin 101), were probably inspired by Milton.  In 1790-92, Blake loosely sketched several illustrations to <i>Paradise Lost</i> in his Notebook (Butlin 201; see Related Works, below).  He composed his first series of water colors illustrating one of Milton's poems in 1801 when the Rev. Joseph Thomas commissioned the eight designs for <i>Comus</i> (Butlin 527).  In 1807, Blake produced the set of <i>Paradise Lost</i> designs presented here (Butlin 529, sometimes called the ""small"" set).  These were also acquired, and probably commissioned, by Thomas.  The date of composition is established by the ""1807"" date inscribed on five of the designs.  Blake executed another series of twelve <i>Paradise Lost</i> designs, with a larger format, in 1808 for his chief patron Thomas Butts (Butlin 536).  In this later group, eleven of the designs are variants of those in the Thomas set, but the fourth design of 1807, ""Satan Spying on Adam and Eve and Raphael's Descent into Paradise,"" is replaced with a different subject, ""Adam and Eve Asleep.""  Blake began a third series of <i>Paradise Lost</i> designs for John Linnell in 1822 (Butlin 537), but apparently completed only the three water colors now extant.</p><p>Here, as usual in his work as an illustrator of other poets' works, Blake paid close attention to the text, but this disciplined approach did not preclude his own interpretations.  For example, Blake's choice of subjects places greater emphasis on Christ's role in Milton's epic than most series of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century illustrations of <i>Paradise Lost</i>. </p><p>Blake's literary response to the life and works of John Milton finds its fullest expression in the illuminated book <i>Milton a Poem</i>.</p>",but529.info.xml,0,
Portrait of George Romney,speng,5/1/1803,bbwba14.1.1.sp.100.jpg,bbwba14.1,bbwba14,"<p>In the final months of his three-year sojourn in Felpham, Blake began working on two sketches based on a painting of a shipwreck and a self-portrait by the artist George Romney. These were prepared as preliminary drawings for engravings to illustrate Hayley's biography of Romney. In a letter to John Flaxman of 7 August 1803, Hayley reveals that Blake had ""made two excellent drawings of Romney,"" one of which was after an unfinished self-portrait of Romney in Hayley's possession, before stating that he intends for both drawings to be ""engraved for a single quarto volume of [Romney's] Life"" (Bentley, <i>Records</i>, page 157). In the same letter, Hayley reveals that after some haggling with Blake over fees, they had agreed on a price of 40 guineas for a portrait engraving of Romney's self-portrait.</p><p>Shortly after he returned to London, Blake wrote to Hayley on 7 October 1803, stating ""I lose no moment to complete Romney to satisfaction"" (Erdman page 736). Over the next few weeks Blake made significant progress on the plate, informing Hayley on 26 October, ""I go on finishing Romney with spirit"" (Erdman page 738). In a letter to Hayley of 13 December, Blake implies that the plate was sufficiently finished for proofs to be taken: ""M<sup>r</sup> Romney[s] Portrait goes on with spirit. I do not send a proof because I cannot get one the Printers [<i>being</i>] &lt;having been this afternoon&gt; unable or unwilling &amp; my Press not yet being put up"" (Erdman page 739). By the beginning of May 1804, Blake had either assembled his own press or convinced the copperplate printer to pull a proof impression, which Blake showed to one of Romney's oldest friends, Adam Walker (Blake's letter to Hayley, 4 May 1804, Erdman page 748). On 22 June Blake offered Hayley another update, citing his former partner, James Parker, to emphasize the plate's quality: ""Head of Romney is in very great forwardness. Parker commends it highly. Flaxman has not yet seen it. but shall soon, &amp; then you shall have a Proof of it for your remarks also"" (Erdman page 753). On 16 July 1804 Blake finally sent Hayley a proof, ""still [in] an unfinishd state"" (Erdman page 753).</p><p>Blake continued to work on the portrait engraving during the second half of 1804. In his letter of 7 August, Blake describes working on ""Romneys Head"" with ""Spirit &amp; neatness."" In a letter to Hayley of 28 September, Blake promises a second proof of the engraving: ""You shall soon see a Proof of Him in a very advancd state. I have not yet proved it but shall soon when I will send you one"" (Erdman page 755). On 23 October Blake claims that he will soon send proofs of ""the Head of R"" and repeats this claim in his letter of 4 December (Erdman pages 756-57). Blake finally sent Hayley the second proof on 18 December and ten days later sent Hayley a letter commenting that ""I am very far from shewing the Portrait of Romney as a finishd Proof. be assured that with our Good Flaxmans good help &amp; with your remarks on it in addition I hope to make it a Supernaculum"" (Erdman pages 758-60). In a postscript, Blake reiterates his claim that the portrait engraving required more work: ""I made a very high finishd Drawing &lt;of Romney&gt; as a Companion to my &lt;drawings of the&gt; head of Cowper (you remember) with which Flaxman is very much satisfied &amp; says that when my Print is like that I need wish it no better, &amp; I am determind to make it so at least"" (Erdman page 760). Despite these assurances, Hayley did not include the engraving in his biography of Romney, not published until 1809. Only Blake's engraving of the shipwreck design appears in the book.</p><p>Blake's sketch for the Romney portrait engraving was auctioned at Sotheby's on 29 April 1862, lot 178, but has not been recorded since that sale. In his 1942 edition of Alexander Gilchrist's <i>Life of William Blake</i>, Ruthven Todd claims that a copy of the engraving was in the Rosenwald Collection. There is, however, no record of it in that collection, now divided between the National Gallery of Art, Washington, and the Library of Congress.  The only known impression, only recently discovered, is the example published here.</p>",bbwba14.info.xml,0,

Blake abandons direct references to contemporary events to pursue the junctures among biblical narrative, the origins of law and religion, and his own developing mythology. Adam, Noah, Socrates, Brama, Los, Urizen and many others represent both historical periods and states of consciousness. The loose narrative structure reaches towards a vision of universal history ending with apocalyptic resurrection.</p><p>Plates 1, 2, 5, and 8 (the frontispiece, title page, and two full-page designs) are color-printed drawings, executed and printed in the planographic manner of&mdash;and probably concurrent with&mdash;most of the twelve Large Color Printed Drawings of 1795, also in the Archive. Plates 3 and 4, which make up ""Africa,"" and Plates 6 and 7, which make up ""Asia,"" were executed first, side by side on two oblong pieces of copper (Plates 3/4, 6/7). Initially executed in this landscape format, the two columns of text of each section were transformed into two single-column vertical pages by printing the oblong plates with one side masked. In Copies C and E, Plates 5 and 8 are differently arranged: 8 follows Plate 1 and 5 is placed at the end in Copy C; 8 follows Plate 3 and 5 follows Plate 6 in Copy E.

"John Flaxman, Compositions From the Works Days and Theogony of Hesiod",comeng,1817,bb456.1.1.com.100.jpg,bb456.1,bb456,"<p>The thirty-seven plates of John Flaxman's illustrations to <i>The Works Days and Theogony of Hesiod</i> are one of Blake's major endeavors as a commercial etcher/engraver of designs by other artists.  Flaxman began to sketch designs based on Hesiod's poems in the early 1790s, but it was not until February 1816 that he entered into a contract with the publisher Longman &amp; Co. to ""furnish a series of Drawings to illustrate Hesiod"" (Bentley page 556).  Blake had already been commissioned to execute the plates, almost certainly on the recommendation of Flaxman, a friend of many years.  Inscriptions on a set of pre-publication proofs in the Bodleian Library indicate that Blake submitted impressions to Longman between November 1814 and October 1816; the project was completed by January 1817.  Blake, who received very few other engraving commissions during this period, was paid 5 guineas (Œ£5.5s.) for each plate, a total of Œ£194.5s. plus Œ£13.13s. as reimbursement for purchasing the copperplates (Longman's records, Bentley page 558).  Without the Hesiod project, Blake and his wife Catherine might have descended into dire poverty.</p><p>Blake executed the Hesiod illustrations in an unusual graphic style.  Rather than continuous outlines, found in the engravings of Flaxman's other classical compositions, Blake used stippled lines&mdash;that is, lines composed of dots.  It is surprising to see Blake, who wrote in a letter of 1827 that ""a Line is a Line in its Minutest Subdivision[s]"" (Erdman page 783), deploying a technique that divides lines into points.  Perhaps he was responding to the character of Flaxman's preliminary drawings, now untraced, upon which the etchings/engravings were based.  If these were in soft pencil, then stippled lines would be an appropriate equivalent.  It is also possible that Flaxman or his publisher directed Blake to use this style.</p><p>The texts accompanying the Hesiod designs were executed in continuous lines by a writing engraver named ""Jeffreys"" in Longman's accounts (Bentley page 557).  The quotations and paraphrases from Hesiod's poems are based on the second edition (1815) of <i>The Remains of Hesiod</i>, translated by Charles Abraham Elton. </p><p>Flaxman's classical compositions were influenced by, and often understood as recreations of, Greek and Etruscan vase paintings.  His illustrations of Homer's <i>Iliad</i> and <i>Odyssey</i> and of Dante's <i>Divine Comedy</i> were published, or at least engraved, in 1793.  They soon became famous and highly influential throughout Europe.  These were followed by designs for the tragedies of Aeschylus in 1795 and Blake's Hesiod engravings in 1817.  Blake also contributed three plates to the 1805 revised publication of the <i>Iliad</i> illustrations.  The Hesiod plates were frequently reprinted and included in <i>The Classical Compositions of John Flaxman</i> of 1870.  The publisher, Bell and Daldy, reportedly sold the copperplates as scrap metal in 1917 (Ruthven Todd, ""Blake's Dante Plates,"" <i>Times Literary Supplement</i>, 29 August 1968, page 928).</p>",bb456.info.xml,0,
"Illustrations to Milton's ""Comus"", The Thomas Set",wc,1801,but527.1.1.wc.100.jpg,but527.1,but527,"<p>The poetry of John Milton was important to Blake as both poet and artist from his earliest years.  As he told John Flaxman in a letter of 12 September 1800, ""Milton lovd me in childhood &amp; shewd me his face"" (Erdman page 707).  Several early drawings, such as the <i>Satan, Sin, and Death</i> of c. 1780 (Butlin 101), were probably inspired by Milton.  In 1790-92, Blake loosely sketched several illustrations to <i>Paradise Lost</i> in his Notebook (Butlin 201; see Related Works, below).  He composed his first series of water colors illustrating one of Milton's poems in 1801 when the Rev. Joseph Thomas commissioned the eight designs for <i>Comus</i> (Butlin 527) presented here.  This commission and its date are established by John Flaxman's comment in a postscript to Blake in a letter to William Hayley of 31 July 1801: ""The Revd. Joseph Thomas of Epsom desires you will at your leisure, make a few sketches of the same size  [as each other], which maybe any size you please from Milton's Comus for Five Guineas"" (Butlin volume 1, page 373).  Thomas later acquired (very probably on commission) a set of twelve water color illustrations to <i>Paradise Lost</i> in 1807 (Butlin 529) and six water colors illustrating ""On the Morning of Christ's Nativity"" in 1809  (Butlin 538).  In about 1815, Blake produced another set of <i>Comus</i> designs for his patron Thomas Butts (Butlin 528).  This later group pictures the same eight subjects, but with many significant differences in motifs and in the positions and portrayals of characters from the poem.</p><p>Here, as usual in his work as an illustrator of other poets' works, Blake paid close attention to the text, but this disciplined approach did not preclude his own interpretations.  For example, Milton ends his masque with joyous dance and song, but Blake ends his illustrations on a more serious note, as indicated by the facial expressions of all six figures.  The selection of passages to illustrate in itself reveals Blake's emphasis on unusual states of consciousness, including trances and visions.</p><p>Blake's literary response to the life and works of John Milton finds its fullest expression in the illuminated book <i>Milton a Poem</i>.</p>",but527.info.xml,0,

Her lover, Theotormon, responds with silence or useless abstractions. This slender plot is but a thread on which Blake hangs Oothoon's questionings of conventional morality. She insists on her inner purity and, in a long concluding lament to the ""Daughters of Albion,"" on the varieties of energetic self-expression that cannot be delimited by materialist philosophies or legalistic codes. The characters and their words represent Blake's critique of colonialism, slavery, sexual repression, and attitudes towards women in his day.</p><p>The eleven plates of <cite>Visions</cite> were etched in relief, with slight touches of white-line work, and first printed in 1793.  This printing produced twelve copies: proof Copy A (black ink, Plates 1-2 and the designs only of Plates 3, 7, 9-10), B and C (raw sienna ink), A, D, and E (yellow ochre ink), and H-M (green ink).

"Edward Young, Night Thoughts",comb,1797,bb515.1.1.com.100.jpg,"bb515.1,bb515.2",bb515,"<p>Although there are no extant documentary records of the contract, it was probably in late 1794 or early 1795 that the publisher Richard Edwards commissioned Blake to illustrate a new, deluxe edition of Edward Young's long meditative poem, <i>The Complaint, and the Consolation; or, Night Thoughts</i>, first published in 1742-45 and generally known by the short title of <i>Night Thoughts</i>.  This was the largest commercial project for which Blake was ever employed.  With what must have been enormous energy, he executed 537 water colors (Butlin 330.1-537) illustrating the poem's nine sections, which Young called ""Nights.""  Edwards began the project by having the pages from the first and second editions of the poem glued into windows cut into large leaves of Whatman wove paper. These text pages were positioned slightly off-center so as to create a lower margin greater than the upper and an outer margin greater than the inner, as in most letterpress books.  Blake filled these large marginal spaces with his designs&mdash;a format retained in the published engravings with the letterpress text of the poem printed in a central framed panel.  Blake was paid the paltry sum of twenty guineas for his water colors, presumably because he expected to receive a great deal more for the engravings.</p><p>Although all the water colors may not have been completed by the spring of 1796, Blake began at that time to etch and engrave a selection of forty-three designs illustrating the first four Nights.  These were published in 1797 as the first of four intended large quarto volumes.  The registration of the plates to the sheets of paper, which were barely large enough to accommodate the engravings, was frequently poor, with the result that even untrimmed copies of the book are missing small marginal areas of some of the designs and/or the imprints and Blake's monogram signatures in the lower margins.  Before any further volumes could be produced, Edwards closed his publishing business.  Blake's disappointment must have been profound.  The failure of the <i>Night Thoughts</i> project may have been one of the reasons why Blake decided, in 1800, to move from London to the village of Felpham on the Sussex coast and place himself under the patronage of William Hayley.</p><p>Most of the water colors bear a cross or star to the left of the line (or first line of the passage) illustrated.  This procedure was continued, somewhat irregularly, through the use of asterisks in the published volume.  In some cases, the line preceded by an asterisk in the engravings is not the same as in the corresponding water colors.  Many copies of the 1797 volume contain a two-page ""Explanation of the Engravings,"" possibly written by Blake's friend and fellow-artist Henry Fuseli.  The texts of these commentaries are included in the Editors' Notes for each plate.</p><p>While Blake based his designs closely on the text, many of the images are based on personifications or metaphors in the poem.  This approach tends to literalize what is only a figure of speech in the text, thereby confounding conventional distinctions between the literal and the metaphoric.  Further, Blake drew heavily on his own repertory of motifs and postures when illustrating Young, and thus there are many parallels between the <i>Night Thoughts</i> designs and the pictures in Blake's illuminated books.  The influence of the <i>Night Thoughts</i> project on Blake's writings is most directly evinced by his division of his long manuscript poem, <i>Vala</i> or <i>The Four Zoas</i> (Bentley 209), into nine Nights.  That manuscript also contains forty-seven pre-publication proofs of the <i>Night Thoughts</i> engravings, with lines of <i>The Four Zoas</i> written in the text panels.  A further group of twenty-four proofs is now in the Houghton Library, Harvard University.</p><p>Copy 1 presented here is uncolored; Copy 2 is one of at least twenty-seven copies with contemporary or near-contemporary hand coloring.  The colorist or colorists have never been convincingly identified.  The same palette appears to have been used for most copies, but the placement of the colors varies somewhat among copies.  Such variation is not characteristic of the commercial hand coloring of the late eighteenth century in which a model is followed very closely.  Some scholars have divided the colored copies into two styles, one dated to c. 1797 and the other to c. 1805.  There are, however, colors common to the palettes of these two styles.  Two copies (Yale Center for British Art and Houghton Library, Harvard University) bear early inscriptions attributing their coloring to Blake; a copy in the Library of Congress has a pencil inscription attributing its coloring to Blake's wife Catherine.  Five copies bear J C (or possibly H) monograms that would seem to relate to their coloring.</p>",bb515.info.xml,0,
"Mary Wollstonecraft, Original Stories from Real Life",comb,"1791, 1796",bb514.3.1.com.100.jpg,"bb514.3,bb514.2",bb514,"<p>In 1788, Joseph Johnson published the first edition of Mary Wollstonecraft's morally instructive narrative for children, <i>Original Stories from Real Life; with Conversations, Calculated to Regulate the Affections, and Form the Mind to Truth and Goodness</i>.  A few years later, Johnson decided to issue a new edition, for which he commissioned Blake to prepare a series of illustrations.  He executed at least eleven monochrome drawings (ten extant, Butlin 244), from which Johnson selected six to be engraved by Blake for publication in the 1791 edition.  The preliminary drawing for Plate 5 is untraced.  Two states of the plates appear variously in copies of the 1791 edition; a third state appears in the 1796 edition.  For descriptions of the states, see the Editors' Notes to the plates in both copies published in the Archive.  </p><p>Modern interpreters of the illustrations for <i>Original Stories</i> have detected a pictorial critique of Wollstonecraft's stories.  Blake appears to have found her morality too calculating, rationalistic, and rigid.  He represents Wollstonecraft's spokesperson, Mrs. Mason, as a domineering presence.  From Blake's perspective, Mason's acts of charity are excessively condescending and tend to reinforce the underlying social conditions that create disparities between wealth and poverty.  As Blake wrote in ""The Human Abstract,"" ""Pity would be no more, / If we did not make somebody Poor"" (Erdman page 27).</p>",bb514.info.xml,0,

All Religions are One,illbk,c. 1788,aro.a.p1.100.jpg,aro.a,aro,"<p>Through aphoristic declarations and accompanying emblem-like designs, Blake argues for the essential unity of all religions as expressions of the ""Poetic Genius"" within all human beings. As the quoted phrase suggests, <cite>All Religions are One</cite> implies the unity of the artistic and religious imagination. Several of the numbered ""Principle[s],"" the term used as a heading to each text plate, assert a causal connection between inner spirit and outer body. Because of shared graphic styles, themes, and genre, <cite>All Religions are One</cite> is closely associated with <cite>There is No Natural Religion</cite> of the same year.</p><p>Blake etched the work on ten small plates c. 1788. There is only one known copy (A), now in the Henry E. Huntington Library and Art Gallery. This copy, lacking the title page now in the Keynes Collection, Fitzwilliam Museum, was printed (with some touches of rudimentary color printing) as a large-paper copy in 1795. Some years later, probably in 1818 or later, Blake returned to these impressions and drew between four and six framing lines in black ink around each plate. The pen and ink work in the designs may have been executed at this same late date. There is one further example of the title page, produced in a different printing and with hand coloring, in the Victoria and Albert Museum.</p>",aro.info.xml,0,
The Pastorals of Virgil,comb,1821,bb504.2.5.com.100.jpg,bb504.2,bb504,"<p>When planning a third edition of his successful school text, <cite>The Pastorals of Virgil</cite>, Robert John Thornton employed Blake to contribute some of the new designs for the two-volume work.  Among his many other endeavors, Thornton was the physician for Blake's patron John Linnell, who probably played a key role in securing the commission.  Blake's assignment was to illustrate Ambrose Philips' English ""imitation"" of Virgil's first eclogue.</p><p>Blake first produced four small designs (the same designs reproduced here as Object 6) as relief etchings on a single copperplate, but this was rejected by Thornton.  There may have been several reasons, including the unconventional style of etching, the semi-nudity of some of the figures, and the difficulties letterpress printers would have encountered with such an unusual matrix.  Apparently Blake was asked to prepare wood engravings, a medium in which he had never before worked, instead of relief etchings.  He executed a series of at least twenty-one pen, pencil, and wash drawings; these were probably approved by Thornton.  The wood engravings that Blake produced from them, however, were far less conventional.  Thornton was again taken aback by Blake's bold transgression of contemporary styles and sensibilities.  Several influential artists, including Linnell and Sir Thomas Lawrence, commended Blake's work; their opinions convinced Thornton to print them in his 1821 edition (Objects 5-8, 10).  Three designs (Object 9) were engraved by a journeyman for the sake of comparison with Blake's own productions in wood, and Thornton added a statement below Blake's first design (Object 5) implying his own hesitations about Blake's artistry.  Pre-publication proofs of Blake's wood engravings show that each group of four were cut on a single block; these were cut apart, slightly reduced in size on all four sides, and printed with brief letterpress captions.  This format, as published in Thornton's Virgil, is preserved in our reproductions.</p><p>In addition to his original wood engravings, Blake contributed six copperplate intaglio engravings picturing famous classical figures (Objects 1-4, 12, 13).  He also executed a reduced drawing, perhaps directly on the woodblock, based on a painting by Nicolas Poussin.  This was cut in the block by John Byfield (Object 11).  All these materials are included in our reproductions.</p><p>Twenty of Blake's preliminary drawings, all executed in monochrome wash, were sold at auction from the Linnell collection in 1918.  These are now widely dispersed; seven are untraced and one drawing in the group (Butlin 769.4) was not engraved.  The present ownership of each drawing is given in the Editors' Notes for the relevant wood engravings (Objects 6-10).  Blake's original woodblocks are in the British Museum.</p><p>Although small in size and almost rejected by the man who commissioned them, Blake's Virgil wood engravings have been among his most influential works.  The young artists who gathered around Blake in his final years, including Samuel Palmer, George Richmond, and Edward Calvert, were deeply inspired by the Virgil engravings.  Palmer called them ""visions of little dells, and nooks, and corners of Paradise""&mdash;an encomium that ignores the darker implications of some designs.  Several twentieth-century British artists, including Graham Sutherland, were also influenced by Blake's wood engravings.</p>",bb504.info.xml,0,

Blake engraved only one of these plates, ""Sketch of a Shipwreck after Romney,"" usually placed facing page 84.</p><p>Blake first produced a drawing after Romney's now lost painting, <i>A Shipwreck at the Cape of Good Hope</i>, which depicts a horseman named Woltemad rescuing survivors. According to Blake's letter to Hayley of 22 June 1804, Flaxman had suggested that this painting should be engraved for Hayley's <i>Life of Romney</i> (Erdman pages 752-53). Blake sent Hayley the preparatory drawing with his letter of 16 July 1804 (Erdman page 753) and, in an untraced letter from Hayley, received permission to begin the engraving. Blake spent the rest of the year working sporadically on the print and keeping Hayley regularly updated on his progress. In his letter of 7 August 1804, Blake informs his patron that he is working on the engraving and in his letter of 28 September 1804 states that he will soon send Hayley a proof (Erdman pages 754-55). He makes similar statements on 23 October and 4 December, before finally sending a proof with his letter to Hayley of 18 December 1804 (Edman pages 756-58).</p><p>In addition to ""Sketch of a Shipwreck after Romney,"" Blake produced a portrait engraving of Romney for Hayley's biography.

"William Hayley, The Life, and Posthumous Writings, of William Cowper",comeng,1803,bb468.1.1.com.100.jpg,bb468.1,bb468,"<p>William Hayley's three-volume biography of his friend and fellow poet, William Cowper, was an immediate success when published and did much to established Cowper's reputation as a man of letters. The first two volumes were published in 1803 and the third the following year. The work contains six plates, all signed by Blake as the engraver. Blake also signed one plate, known as ""The Weather House"" (Object 4) as the designer, although the roundel in the lower portion of the design picturing three hares was probably based on a design by George Romney. Blake's work on these engravings was scrutinized by members of Hayley's circle, notably Cowper's cousin, Lady Harriet Hesketh, and their criticisms may have led to some of the friction that appears in Blake's relationship with Hayley from 1801 onward.</p><p>The plates for Hayley's biography of Cowper constitute one of the first commissions Blake worked on during his three-year sojourn on the West Sussex coast. In a letter to Thomas Butts of 11 September 1801, Blake states that his ""Principal labour at this time is Engraving Plates for Cowpers Life"" (Erdman page 716). Writing to his brother James two years later, on 30 January 1803, Blake states that his wife Catherine ""has undertaken to Print the whole number of the Plates for [the first two volumes of] Cowpers work"" (Erdman page 726). </p><p>Blake made two drawings of Cowper after Romney's portrait of the poet.  These were the basis for two miniature paintings of Cowper and the portrait engraving that is the frontispiece for Hayley's biography (Object 1). There are also four drawings of the designs for Cowper's funeral monument that Blake produced at Hayley's request in 1802.  The first two drawings are Hayley's first idea for the monument and were sent to John Flaxman who was commissioned to sculpt the monument. The third drawing revises Hayley's first idea and was the basis from Flaxman's finished monument as well as Blake's engraving, which was published in the third volume of Hayley's biography (Object 6). Blake made two drawings of this second idea, presumably one for Flaxman to sculpt and the other for Blake to engrave.</p>",bb468.info.xml,0,
"William Hayley, An Essay on Sculpture",comeng,1800,bb467.1.1.com.100.jpg,bb467.1,bb467,"<p>Published in 1800 and dedicated to John Flaxman, Hayley's verse epistle celebrating sculpture as one of the sister arts contains three plates, two of which are signed by Blake.  Epistolary evidence indicates that Blake was responsible for the unsigned plate.</p><p>By the end of 1799, Hayley was hurrying to prepare the poem for publication before the death of his terminally ill son, Thomas Alphonso Hayley. In a letter to Flaxman of 21 December, Hayley states ""I wish to have only the two following Decorations, if you approve them&mdash;a Frontispiece &amp; a vignette at the close&mdash;the first from poor Toms outline of Demosthenes at the base of Neptunes Statue . . . &amp; a neat small Head, as a closing vignette, from your medallion of the dear disciple [Thomas Hayley]"" (Bentley, <i>Records</i> page 85). In January 1800, Blake had been commissioned to execute these engravings (Objects 2 and 3), probably through the recommendation of Flaxman. In addition, Blake engraved the bust of Pericles after a drawing by Tom Hayley that became the frontispieces in the published work.  With his letter of 1 April 1800, Blake sent Hayley a proof of the medallion of Tom Hayley (Erdman page 705). On 17 April, Hayley responded with some criticisms of the proof and, after his son's death on 2 May, invited Blake to Felpham to complete the engraving (Bentley, <i>Records</i> pages 87-88, 90). </p><p>Blake spent at least three weeks working beside Hayley in Felpham during July 1800. He completed both a half-length drawing of Thomas Alphonso and the engraving of the medallion portrait (Object 3). Later that year, after Blake had relocated to Sussex, he painted a series of 18 portrait heads to decorate Hayley's library, including portraits of Thomas Alphonso and Demosthenes.</p>",bb467.info.xml,0,
"William Hayley, Designs to a Series of Ballads",comb,1802,bb466.2.1.com.100.jpg,bb466.2,bb466,"<p>While Blake was resident in Felpham on the Sussex coast, his new patron William Hayley began to write a series of ballads to be illustrated by the artist-engraver.  These were published in 1802 as quarto numbers, each with three engravings by Blake.  As the general title page indicates, the poems all deal with ""Anecdotes Relating to Animals.""  In his ""Preface,"" Hayley states that his plan was to issue one ballad a month, ""and to complete the whole series in fifteen Numbers.""  The letterpress text was printed by the Chichester printer Joseph Seagrave; the plates were printed by Blake and his wife Catherine on their own rolling press.  Although two book dealers, P. Humphry and R. H. Evans, were selected to sell the ballads, most copies seem to have been sold by Hayley to his friends.  Sales were less than brisk and the project ceased after only four ballads were issued.

"William Hayley, Ballads ... Relating to Animals",comb,1805,bb465.2.1.com.100.jpg,bb465.2,bb465,"<p>While Blake was resident in Felpham on the Sussex coast, his new patron William Hayley began to write a series of ballads to be illustrated by the artist-engraver.  These were published in 1802 as quarto numbers, each with three engravings by Blake.  As the general title page indicates, the poems all deal with ""Anecdotes Relating to Animals.""  Sales were less than brisk and the project ceased after only four ballads were issued.  In January 1805, Hayley contacted the London bookseller Richard Phillips about publishing a new, octavo edition of the ballads.  Blake began to execute engravings for this edition no later than March and completed five plates by June.  For this 1805 volume, Hayley added twelve ballads to the four first published in 1802.  Blake engraved new plates of his designs for three of the 1802 ballads (plates 1-3) and both designed and engraved new illustrations for two of the additional ballads (plates 4-5).  Blake and Phillips were to ""go equal shares í_ in the expense and the profits"" (Blake's letter to Hayley of 22 January 1805, Erdman page 763).

"Drawings for ""The Pastorals of Virgil""",mono,1820,but769.1.1.wd.100.jpg,but769.1,but769,"<p>When planning a third edition of his successful school text, <i>The Pastorals of Virgil</i>, Robert John Thornton employed Blake to contribute some of the new designs for the two-volume work.  Among his many other endeavors, Thornton was the physician for Blake's patron John Linnell, who probably played a key role in securing the commission.  Blake's assignment was to illustrate Ambrose Philips' English ""imitation"" of Virgil's first eclogue.</p><p>Blake first produced four small designs as relief etchings on a single copperplate, but this was rejected by Thornton.  There may have been several reasons, including the unconventional style of etching, the semi-nudity of some of the figures, and the difficulties letterpress printers would have encountered with such an unusual matrix.  Apparently Blake was asked to prepare wood engravings, a medium in which he had never before worked, instead of relief etchings.  He executed a series of at least twenty-one pen, pencil, and wash drawings; these were probably approved by Thornton.  The wood engravings that Blake produced from them, however, were far less conventional.  Thornton was again taken aback by Blake's bold transgression of contemporary styles and sensibilities.  Several influential artists, including Linnell and Sir Thomas Lawrence, commended Blake's work; their opinions convinced Thornton to print them in his 1821 edition.  Three designs were engraved by a journeyman for the sake of comparison with Blake's own productions in wood, and Thornton added a statement below Blake's first design implying his own hesitations about Blake's artistry.</p><p>We present here a selection of Blake's preliminary drawings.  Twenty of these were sold at auction from the Linnell collection in 1918.  These are now widely dispersed.  The present ownership of each drawing reproduced here is recorded on the Work Information page.  Seven drawings are untraced and one drawing in the Linnell group (Butlin 769.4) was not engraved.  Blake almost certainly executed a preliminary drawing for his first wood engraving, but none has ever been recorded.</p>",but769.info.xml,0,
"Illustrations to Dante's ""Divine Comedy""",wc,1824-27,but812.1.1.wc.100.jpg,but812.1,but812,"<p>Blake's 102 drawings illustrating Dante's <i>Divine Comedy</i> were commissioned by John Linnell, the chief patron of Blake's final years. Although Linnell did not begin to pay for the designs until December 1825, at the rate of about 1 pound a week, Blake probably began work on the drawings by the fall of 1824. They were left at Blake's death in 1827 in various stages of completion, ranging from pencil sketches to highly finished water colors. Most show an expressive freedom in the handling of color washes far greater than Blake's earlier water colors. In 1826, Blake began to engrave large plates based on 7 of the designs; these were also left incomplete at his death. The water colors remained in Linnell's collection and estate until their sale at auction in 1918. Through a scheme organized by the National Art-Collections Fund, they were dispersed among 7 participating institutions: the Ashmolean Museum, Birmingham Museums &amp; Art Gallery, the British Museum, the Fogg Art Museum, the National Gallery of Victoria, the Royal Institution of Cornwall, and the Tate Collection.</p><p>As we generally find with Blake's illustrations to the works of other writers, he has paid close attention to the details of Dante's poem. Yet, while faithful to the text, Blake also brings his own perspective to bear on some of Dante's central themes, including sin, guilt, punishment, revenge, and salvation. In several designs, Blake's pictorial imagery, particularly when associated with similar motifs in his illuminated books and their iconography, indicates a critical attitude towards Dante. This interpretation of the illustrations is buttressed by Blake's verbal criticisms of Dante found in his c. 1800 annotations to Henry Boyd's translation of <i>The Inferno</i>, his conversations with Henry Crabb Robinson in 1825, and his inscriptions on the rectos of a few of the Dante designs themselves. But harsh criticism coexists with many signs of intellectual sympathy in the illustrations.</p><p>We have recorded in the Editors' Notes the inscriptions on the versos of the designs. None of these is attributable to Blake; some probably represent at least 2 attempts to organize the designs into their proper sequence. The arrangement of images given here accords with our understanding of the sequence of passages illustrated and varies at several junctures from Butlin's ordering.</p>",but812.info.xml,0,
George Cumberland's Card,spb,1827,esxxi.1.1.sp.100.jpg,esxxi.1,esxxi.1,"<p>This small card is Blake's last work as an engraver.  The design and its execution in copper were commissioned by his friend of many years, George Cumberland.  The card may have been originally intended as a calling card rather than a bookplate.  The early history of the plate is well documented.  Blake first refers to it in his letter to Cumberland of 12 April 1827: ""The Little Card I will do as soon as Possible but when you Consider that I have been reduced to a Skeleton from which I am slowly recovering you will I hope have Patience with me"" (Erdman page 784).  Blake's fatal illness did indeed impede work on the engraving, left unfinished at his death on 12 August 1827.  Cumberland's son, George Jr., took delivery of the copperplate from Blake's wife Catherine on 17 January 1828 and paid her Œ£3.3s. for it.  Shortly after receiving the plate, George Jr. wrote to his father that ""M.<sup>rs</sup> Blake sends her Compts with many thanks[;] she tells me that the Card would have been more finished if WB had lived[,] that it was the last thing he attempted to engrav"" (Bentley, <i>Records</i>, page 482).</p><p>Cumberland had sent a copperplate of his calling card to Blake so that he could add a design to it.  This plate very probably already had Cumberland's name engraved on it by a writing engraver.  Even if Blake began with a new piece of copper, a writing engraver may have added the name.  Blake appears to have executed his design with the graver and drypoint needle without preliminary etching.  Most extant impressions are on paper rather than card, in either black or brown ink, and may have been printed after Cumberland's death in 1848.  There are no recorded impressions of the plate lacking Cumberland's name; the copperplate itself is untraced.</p><p>Blake inscribed the plate, lower right, with his name and age, ""A �Í 70.""  He may have sensed that 1827 could well be the last year of his life, but took pride in being capable of pursuing his art and craft to the end.  Blake was in fact 69 when he died; perhaps he inscribed ""70"" on the Cumberland card in anticipation of working on it until he turned that age.  At least when considered in retrospect, this most unusual inscription contributes to the elegiac and prophetic iconography of the design.</p>",esxxi.info.xml,0,

Historical events are reconfigured into their universalized representations through Blake's own cast of characters, including Enitharmon, the female personification of fallen nature and history, Orc, the spirit of revolt, and Los and Urizen, the ""Eternals"" who would become central to Blake's mythic system of the ""Zoas."" These contending forces lead beyond political revolution to an apocalypse of biblical scope.

These groups lack the same seven plates absent from Copy A and are from the same first printing. Some posthumous impressions were added to these groups by nineteenth-century owners. Copies B-G were also produced in 1794, perhaps shortly after the proof printing. There are only two later printings: 1795 (Copies A and H) and 1821 (Copy K).

Songs of Innocence,illbk,1789,s-inn.l.p2.100.jpg,"s-inn.l,s-inn.u,s-inn.g,s-inn.b",s-inn,"<p>This lyric anthology evokes a predominantly pastoral world prior to the dualisms of adult consciousness. Human, natural, and divine states of being have yet to be separated. The child is the chief representative of this condition; other recurrent figures, such as the shepherd and lamb, point ultimately to the figure of Christ as the incarnation of the unity of innocence. In a few poems, the rhetoric, irony, and divided consciousness of experience begin to insinuate themselves into the landscape of innocence. In 1794, Blake combined <cite>Innocence</cite> with its contrary companion, the <cite>Songs of Experience</cite>, to create the combined <cite>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</cite>.</p><p>Blake etched the <cite>Songs of Innocence</cite> in relief, with white-line work in some designs, on thirty-one plates in 1789, the date on the title page. The first printing, also of 1789, produced seventeen (or possibly eighteen) copies: U, W, and possibly untraced Copy V were printed in black ink on 31 leaves; I, J, X, and ""Innocence"" of <cite>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</cite> Copy F were printed in green ink on both sides of the leaves; A-H, K-M, Z were printed in the same style in yellow ochre or raw sienna ink. In addition, the ""Innocence"" section of what would later become <cite>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</cite> Copies B-E were printed in this first session. The first copies, printed in black ink on one side of the leaves, were uncolored, appearing more like a book of prints than a book of poems; all the subsequent copies were colored and, with images on both sides of the leaves, had facing pages characteristic of books, though the light imprint, wiped plate borders, and simple washes made these copies appear like ""printed manuscripts.""</p><p>After 1794, the printing history of <cite>Innocence</cite> becomes complex because Blake began printing it with <cite>Experience</cite> to form copies of the combined <cite>Songs</cite> while continuing also to issue <cite>Songs of Innocence</cite> and <cite>Songs of Experience</cite> separately. Complicating matters further are the facts that some separately issued copies of <cite>Innocence</cite> were combined with <cite>Experience</cite> by collectors and dealers, and that copies of <cite>Innocence</cite> now separate were once part of copies of the combined <cite>Songs</cite>.</p><p>In 1795, Blake printed both sections of <cite>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</cite> Copies A and R. In a separate print-run of the same year, he printed eight sets of <cite>Innocence</cite> and nine sets of <cite>Experience</cite> impressions to form <cite>Innocence</cite> Copy N, the ""Innocence"" section of combined <cite>Songs</cite> Copy J, the ""Experience"" section of combined <cite>Songs</cite> Copies J, O, and S, and both sections of combined <cite>Songs</cite> I, L, M, and BB.

"Illustrations to Milton's ""L'Allegro"" and ""Il Penseroso""",wc,c. 1816-20,but543.1.1.wc.100.jpg,but543.1,but543,"<p>The poetry of John Milton was important to Blake as both poet and artist from his earliest years. As he told John Flaxman in a letter of 12 September 1800, ""Milton lovd me in childhood &amp; shewd me his face"" (Erdman page 707). Several early drawings, such as the <cite>Satan, Sin, and Death</cite> of c. 1780 (Butlin 101), were probably inspired by Milton. In 1790-92, Blake loosely sketched several illustrations to <cite>Paradise Lost</cite> in his Notebook (Butlin 201; see Related Works, below). He composed his first series of water colors illustrating one of Milton's poems in 1801 when the Rev. Joseph Thomas commissioned eight designs for <cite>Comus</cite> (Butlin 527). Thomas later acquired (very probably on commission) a set of twelve water color illustrations to <cite>Paradise Lost</cite> in 1807 (Butlin 529) and six water colors illustrating ""On the Morning of Christ's Nativity"" in 1809 (Butlin 538). Between 1808 and 1815, Blake produced similar (but not in every respect identical) sets of the <cite>Paradise Lost</cite> and ""Nativity"" designs for Thomas Butts (Butlin 529, 542), to which he added the twelve illustrations to ""L'Allegro"" and ""Il Penseroso"" c. 1816-20 (Butlin 543) presented here. Although we can be confident that Butts was the first owner of these illustrations and very probably commissioned them, there are no extant records of such a commission. The dating of the water colors is based on the presence of an ""1816"" watermark in six of the designs and on stylistic features, particularly the high degree of finish with fine brush strokes, indicative of Blake's later style.</p><p>Each design is accompanied by a separate sheet of paper on which Blake wrote in pen and ink a brief title, now considered the verso of each sheet because glued to a backing sheet. The rectos of the inscribed sheets bear pen and ink quotations, in Blake's hand, of the lines illustrated, to which Blake added his own comments on the motifs pictured. These quotations and comments are of course important in understanding Blake's pictorial responses to ""L'Allegro"" and ""Il Penseroso."" The rectos of these inscribed sheets are presented here, each following the water color to which it refers. Because of the backing sheets, the verso inscriptions can only be read with the aid of a strong backing light, but they cannot be photographed. Thus, they are included here in the Editors' Notes, but they are not reproduced.</p><p>As is typical of his work as an illustrator of the works of other poets, Blake paid close attention to the text, but this disciplined approach did not preclude the inclusion of his own interpretations. In itself the selection of passages to illustrate indicates Blake's emphasis on imaginative states of consciousness, including dreams and visions.</p><p>Blake's literary response to the life and works of John Milton finds its fullest expression in the illuminated book <cite>Milton a Poem</cite> (c. 1804-10; see Related Works, below).</p>",allegropenseroso.info.xml,0,
"Illustrations to Robert Blair's ""The Grave""",wc,1805,butwba10.1.1.100.jpg,butwba10.1,butwba10,"<p>In October 1805, Blake was commissioned by the engraver and would-be publisher Robert H. Cromek to prepare forty drawings illustrating Robert Blair's <i>The Grave</i>, a popular ""Graveyard"" school poem first published in 1743. Cromek planned to select twenty of these designs for a de luxe edition of the poem. In Cromek's first prospectus of November 1805, Blake is named as both the designer and engraver of fifteen designs. Blake etched one image, ""Deaths Door,"" in white-line, but Cromek rejected it. The dark power of the white-line print appeals to modern tastes, but was far from fashionable in the early nineteenth century. In a second prospectus, also of November 1805, Cromek announced that Louis Schiavonetti would engrave twelve designs for the new edition. Blake had lost the potentially lucrative commission to engrave his own designs; his relationship with Cromek descended into anger and argument. In spite of their disagreement, Cromek included a portrait of Blake as a frontispiece to the volume, published in 1808. Cromek promoted the book aggressively and the illustrations to <i>The Grave</i> became Blake's best known work through much of the nineteenth century. </p><p> We present here the twenty water-color illustrations originally selected by Cromek for publication. These were sold at an auction in Edinburgh in 1836, but were unknown until the dramatic rediscovery of nineteen of the water colors in 2001. These were sold individually at auction in May 2006 and are now widely dispersed; most are now in private collections. For details about provenance and current ownership, see the Work Information page.</p><p> One design originally part of the group, as indicated by the size and style of its backing mat, became detached from its companions, probably in the mid-nineteenth century. This work, <i>The Widow Embracing her Husband's Grave</i> (Yale Center for British Art, Butlin 633), has been included here. The designs are arranged according to the sequence of passages illustrated, with those designs not based on any specific passage in Blair's poem grouped at the end. </p> <p> Schiavonetti's engravings published in Cromek's 1808 edition of <a href=""&#xA; /blake/work/bb435"">Robert Blair, <i>The Grave</i></a> and the white-line etching of <a href=""&#xA; /blake/work/esxiii"">""Deaths Door""</a> are also available in the Archive (see Commercial Book Illustrations, and Separate Prints and Prints in Series, in the main table of ""Works in the William Blake Archive"").

According to his <i>Memoirs</i>, Hayley composed the poem on 22 September 1800 ""to relieve the necessities of a meritorious poor Woman on the Kentish coast"" (Bentley, <i>Records</i>, pages 99-100). In a letter to Thomas Butts of 23 September, Blake states, ""I have begun to Work &amp; find í_ that Felpham is propitious to the Arts"" (Erdman page 711). Blake was almost certainly referring to <i>Little Tom the Sailor</i>, which comprises head and tailpiece designs on separate plates, etched and engraved in white line, and the texts of Hayley's ballad and a colophon etched in relief on two copperplates.</p><p>Hayley probably gave Blake the ballad to etch on the day of its composition or shortly thereafter. The ballad was published, according to the colophon, on 5 October 1800. It therefore took Blake approximately thirteen days to relief etch the texts as well as design and execute the two illustrations. A preliminary sketch of the headpiece is in the Victoria and Albert Museum. To print the ballad, Blake placed his four plates one above the other in his rolling press and printed them on one leaf of paper.</p><p>By the end of the November 1800, the initial print run appears to have almost sold out. In a letter to Hayley of 26 November, Blake, referring to the ballad, claims, ""we can muster a few in colours and some in black which I hope will be no less favour'd tho' they are rough like rough sailors"" (Erdman page 714).

"William Hayley, The Triumphs of Temper",comeng,1803,bb471.1.1.com.100.jpg,bb471.1,bb471,"<p>First published in 1781, William Hayley's long mock-epic poem was one of the most popular works of the final decades of the eighteenth century. Heavily indebted to Alexander Pope's <i>The Rape of the Lock</i>, Hayley's didactic poem seeks to teach adolescent girls to become accomplished wives by exercising their temper.  The sixth edition of the poem, published in 1788, was the first to be illustrated; it contains seven plates after designs by Thomas Stothard. In 1803, Hayley commissioned Blake to engrave a series of new illustrations based on designs by  John Flaxman's half-sister, Maria Flaxman, for a twelfth edition of the poem. She produced seven designs, of which Blake engraved six.</p><p>Blake worked on these plates for the first six months of 1803. In his letter to Thomas Butts of 10 January 1803, Blake reports that he was ""now engaged in Engraving 6 small plates for a New Edition of M<sup>r</sup> Hayleys Triumphs of Temper. from drawings by Maria Flaxman sister to my friend the Sculptor"" (Erdman page 723). At the end of the month, on 30 January, Blake informs his brother James of the commission and state that he would be paid ""10 G[uineas]"" for each plate (Erdman page 726). By the end of June, the engravings were evidently complete, for Hayley sent a copy of the twelfth edition to Lady Harriet Hesketh, William Cowper's cousin. In a letter of 1 July, she tells Hayley of her disappointment with the prints. In a letter to John Flaxman of 7 August 1803, Hayley, presumably referring to Hesketh's comments, states: ""I am sorry to say that the Ladies (&amp; it is a Ladys Book) find fault with the Engravings&mdash; our poor industrious Blake has received sixty Guineas for them from my Bookseller &amp; I believe both the artist &amp; the paymaster are dissatisfied on the occasion"" (Bentley, <i>Records</i> page 157). In the same letter, Hayley also reports that he and Blake made the decision to omit from the engravings the figure of Minerva represented in one of Maria Flaxman's original designs. In response, John Flaxman remarked in a letter to Hayley of 24 August 1803 that one of his half-sister's drawings depicting ""Serena viewing herself in the Glass when dressed for the Masquerade whilst her Maid adjusts her train"" was overlooked for engraving (Bentley, <i>Records</i> page 166).</p><p>Two of Maria Flaxman's original designs were on display at the Royal Academy annual exhibition in 1800. All seven drawings were sold at auction at Christie's on 26 February 1883. These are currently untraced.</p><p>Blake's engravings were repeated in a very small print run of the thirteenth edition of <i>The Triumphs of Temper</i>, published in 1807.

Combined <cite>Songs</cite> Copy E also consists mostly of impressions from  these print runs, but appears to have been assembled or at least  recolored c. 1806 for Blake's patron Thomas Butts.</p> <p>The first copies of the combined <cite>Songs</cite> in which the  two sections were printed together were A and R in 1795. That same  year, Blake printed eight sets of <cite>Innocence</cite> and nine  sets of <cite>Experience</cite> impressions to form  <cite>Innocence</cite> Copy N, the ""Innocence"" section of combined  <cite>Songs</cite> Copy J, the ""Experience"" sections of combined  <cite>Songs</cite> Copies J, O, and S, and both sections of  combined <cite>Songs</cite> Copies I, L, M, and BB. ""Innocence"" of  combined <cite>Songs</cite> Copy O was once joined with  ""Experience"" of combined <cite>Songs</cite> Copy K, and untraced  <cite>Innocence</cite> Copy W was probably once combined with  ""Experience"" of combined <cite>Songs</cite> Copy N. In c. 1802,  Blake printed three copies of <cite>Innocence</cite> (O, R and Y  printed as a single copy and later divided into two incomplete  copies, and the ""Innocence"" section of combined <cite>Songs</cite>  Copy P), along with two copies of <cite>Experience</cite> (the  ""Experience"" sections of combined <cite>Songs</cite> Copies P and  Q). In c. 1804, he printed another three copies of  <cite>Innocence</cite> (P, Q, and the ""Innocence"" section of  combined <cite>Songs</cite> Copy Q); in c. 1811 he printed two more  copies (<cite>Innocence</cite> Copy S and the ""Innocence"" section  of combined <cite>Songs</cite> Copy S).</p> <p>Between 1818 and 1827, <cite>Innocence</cite> and  <cite>Experience</cite> were always printed as part of the combined  <cite>Songs</cite>. In c. 1818, Blake printed combined  <cite>Songs</cite> Copies T2 and U; in c. 1821, Copy V; in 1825,  Copies W and Y; in 1826, Copies Z and AA; and in 1827, Copy X. In  all but Copy V, the plate order is the same, though Copy T2 has had  Plate 49 repositioned and a few <cite>Innocence</cite> poems  replaced with earlier impressions. The plate order in these last copies and in ""Innocence"" of combined <cite>Songs</cite> Copy S (c.  1811) follows, with minor variations, the plate order of combined <cite>Songs</cite> Copy R, which was Blake's personal copy until he  sold it to John Linnell in 1819.

Thel, a virgin shepherdess burdened by her sense of mortality, seeks meaning for her life by talking with several creatures&mdash;a lily, cloud, worm, and clod of clay. These speaking symbols of life's transience are satisfied with their lot because all believe themselves to be part of natural cycles related through self-sacrifice to a higher purpose. On the final plate, Thel comes to her grave and hears her own unanswered questions redolent with fears of both death and sexuality. This voice, and Thel's flight from it, indicate either her failure to accept the harsh facts of life or the failure of her interlocutors' philosophy to satisfy the human desire for transcendental truths.</p> <p>Blake etched <cite>The Book of Thel</cite> in relief, with a few touches of white-line work, on eight plates in 1789, the date on the title page, and 1790. Plate 1, ""Thel's Motto,"" and Plate 8, the final plate, which may be a substitute for an earlier version of the poem (although there is no evidence that any such early version was etched), appear to have been etched later than Plates 2-7.Their lettering style is present in <cite>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</cite> but not in <cite>Thel</cite>'s other plates. Both plates are missing from the first copy of <cite>Thel</cite>printed, proof Copy A (black ink, Plates 2-5, 7 only, with Plate 6 and a duplicate Plate 2 in the San Francisco Public Library). This first printing of the finished work can be divided into five issues according to ink color: Copies H-L (green), B, E, M (raw sienna), A, D, R (orange-yellow ochre), C (raw umber), and G (blue). Untraced Copies P and Q may also be from this printing; but, given gaps in the relevant provenances, they might also be the same as Copies G and H. Large-paper Copy F, with rudimentary color printing, was produced in 1795; Copies N and O can be dated to c.1818.

His first efforts were a small group of wash drawings of the mid-1780s showing Job in his misery with his wife and three friends (Butlin 162-164).  Another version of this subject appears among Blake's emblem series that he sketched in his Notebook (Butlin 201.20), but the composition appearing in the wash drawings culminated in the large intaglio etching/engraving, ""Job"" (Essick V), which Blake listed in his advertisement <i>To the Public</i> of 10 October 1793.  This print may have stimulated Blake's chief patron, Thomas Butts, to commission a tempera painting, <i>Job and His Daughters</i> (Butlin 394) c. 1799-1800 and, about six years later, a series of nineteen water colors illustrating the story of Job (Butlin 550, the so-called ""Butts set"").  In 1821, Blake and his new patron John Linnell borrowed the water colors from Butts.  Linnell traced the series and Blake colored them (Butlin 551, the so-called ""Linnell set"").  Blake also added two more compositions to this later group and added versions of these same compositions to the earlier group, so that both sets now have twenty-one designs.  The Linnell set led directly to his commissioning engravings.

Job's sufferings are recorded in the first half of the series, culminating in his horrific vision of a devil-god in the eleventh design.  Job's spiritual education and material restoration are pictured in the second half of the series.

An Island in the Moon,ms,c. 1784-85,bb74.1.1.ms.100.jpg,bb74.1,bb74,"<p>Perhaps drawing on a literary tradition of moon-voyage or flight narratives, Blake sets the   earliest extended manifestation of his penchant for satire ""In the Moon"" on a ""certain Island""   with ""some affinity to England"" (<a href=""&#xA;            /blake/copy/bb74.1?descId=bb74.1.ms.01"">Object 1</a>, page 1,   Erdman page 449), which provides the domestic settings&mdash;study, parlor, garden&mdash;for a boisterous   sendup of middle class London social and intellectual life distilled into eleven brief chapters   of ""Great confusion &amp; disorder"" (<a href=""&#xA;            /blake/copy/bb74.1?descId=bb74.1.ms.10"">Object 10</a>).   The use of dialogue interspersed with song lyrics links <i>An Island in the Moon</i> to both   contemporary theatrical forms and broader eighteenth-century traditions of satirical narrative.   Blake's experiences in the London social circle of the Rev. A. S. Mathew and his wife Harriet in   the 1780s may be the main inspiration for these mocking reflections, which feature impertinent,   passionate, confrontational characters, some if not all derived from Blake's contemporaries. The philosopher-trio Suction the Epicurean, Quid the Cynic (perhaps Robert and William Blake), and   Sipsop the Pythagorean join such companions as Inflammable Gass the Wind Finder, Obtuse Angle,   and Mrs. Nannicantipot in a swirl of idle gossip, recitation, rude joking, drunken singing, and passionate wrangling about topics of current interest: ""Fissic Follogy, Pistinology[,] . . . Hogamy HAtomy, &amp; hall that"" (<a href=""&#xA;       /blake/copy/bb74.1?descId=bb74.1.ms.05"">Object 5</a>). The   resulting disarray, bordering on farce &mdash;""O ay come Ill sing you a song said the Cynic. the   trumpeter shit in his hat said the Epicurean"" (<a href=""&#xA;         /blake/copy/bb74.1?descId=bb74.1.ms.03"">Object 3</a>) &mdash; is a self-undermining scramble that deflates nearly every pretense to lyricism or serious thought. Blake, writing in his mid to late 20s, demonstrates a born satirist's instincts for the ridiculous. Though satire is never entirely absent from the illuminated books, only in <i>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</i> (1790) is it the dominant mode. <i>An Island in the Moon</i> underscores the importance of the extensive stretches of humor and satire that show up frequently among his other writings. So, although Blake left it orphaned, untitled, and   unfinished in a heavily revised manuscript, <i>Island</i> is in some sense a primary literary experiment for him, setting the undertone of much to follow.</p><p><i>Island</i> is an incomplete manuscript written in pen and ink in Blake's hand. It notably contains the earliest extant drafts of ""Nurse's Song,"" ""HOLY THURSDAY,"" and ""The Little Boy Lost,"" which make their first published appearance in his <i>Songs of Innocence</i> (1789). The   history of Blake's associations with the Mathew circle, along with topical allusions to balloon hats&mdash;a short-lived fashion associated with early demonstrations of ballooning&mdash;and the performing monkey General Jacko, suggest a period of composition c. 1784-85. Before the manuscript was   given to the Fitzwilliam Museum in 1905, two or more leaves may have been removed, stranding the passage ("". . . them Illuminating the Manuscript . . ."") that begins abruptly on <a href=""&#xA;            /blake/copy/bb74.1?descId=bb74.1.ms.17"">Object 17</a>.

The sketches and lettering on the verso of Object 18 may reflect   Robert Blake's attempts to draw subjects that had been set as exercises for him by older brother William, and, in some instances, corrected by one of them (see the Object Note under Editors' Notes for Object 18).

In the first, Blake states basic principles, derived from the philosophy of John Locke and his followers, about physical perception, reason, and the limits of knowledge. The second series redefines and confutes the first and argues for the infinitude of spiritual perceptions. Shared graphic styles, themes, and genre closely associate <cite>There is No Natural Religion</cite> with<cite>All Religions are One</cite>.</p><p>Blake etched the work in relief on twenty small plates c. 1788.A few designs show touches of white-line work. Impressions of only nineteen plates are now extant; no impression is known from the plate that presumably bore proposition ""III"" in series b. Only two printings are known. The first, c. 1794, is an abridgment consisting of twelve plates (a1-9; b3, 4, 12). These show rudimentary color printing and hand tinting on some plates. This printing is represented by Copies A-D, G, and M, although later extractions and additions in some of these copies have obscured Blake's intentions for his abridgment, in which the Lockean principles of series a are directly refuted by the three plates from series b. The second printing (1795) contains ten plates from series b (b1, 3, 4, 6, 7-12) plus the title page from series a(a2). Only a single large-paper copy (L), printed as a companion to the large-paper copy (A) of <cite>All Religions are One</cite>, plus a few loose pulls, are known from this printing.

Stedman's <i>Narrative</i> contains a frontispiece to volume 1, an engraved vignette on the title page of each of the two volumes, and eighty numbered full-page plates (including three maps).  Thirteen of the numbered plates are signed by Blake; a further three unsigned plates (7, 12, and 14) have been attributed to Blake by modern scholars.  As both title pages indicate, the full-page plates are based on drawings by Stedman.  None of the drawings on which Blake based his engravings has been traced, but it is likely that Blake made various minor alterations in Stedman's amateur designs.</p><p>Blake began work on the Stedman plates in 1791.  Stedman visited Blake in June 1794 and subsequently the engraver helped the author with various business matters, very probably including negotiations with the book's publisher, Joseph Johnson.  Blake's attitudes towards slavery and colonialism were indebted to Stedman's autobiographical narrative, as is particularly evident in the texts and designs of his illuminated books <i>Visions of the Daughters of Albion</i> and <i>America</i>, both dated 1793.  Stedman's relationship with a female slave, Joanna, may have influenced Blake's complex representations of gender and sexuality.</p><p>Most, possibly all, of the large-paper copies issued in 1796 have hand-colored plates that include touches of liquefied gold and silver.  This tinting was very probably executed by anonymous commercial colorists hired by Johnson.  A second edition was issued in 1806 and reprinted in 1813.  Some copies of these two later issues also have hand-colored plates, but in a style different from the 1796 coloring.</p>",bb499.info.xml,0,

The cast of characters is vast, but Los (the artist's imagination at work in the material world), Jerusalem and Albion (the female and male portions of divided humanity who must be reunited), the nature goddess Vala, and Jesus play major roles. The poem is divided into four chapters, each addressed to a different audience: the Public, the Jews, the Deists, and the Christians. <cite>Jerusalem</cite> concludes with a vision of human consciousness in a post-apocalyptic universe.

In the next year, Blake printed Copies B (chapter 1 only, Plates 1-25) and E. Copy F was printed, but left uncollated by Blake, in 1827. Copies H-J are posthumous. There are two arrangements of the plates in chapter 2, early (Copies A and C) and late (Copies D and E). Copy F was collated by John Linnell, using Copy C as a model.

Deaths Door,spb,1805,esxiii.1.1.sp.100.jpg,esxiii.1,esxiii,"<p>In October 1805, Blake was commissioned by the engraver and would-be publisher Robert H. Cromek to prepare forty drawings illustrating Robert Blair's <a href=""&#xA; /blake/work/bb435""> <i>The Grave</i></a>, a popular ""Graveyard"" school poem first published in 1743. Cromek planned to select twenty of these designs for a de luxe edition of the poem. In Cromek's first prospectus of November 1805, Blake is named as both the designer and engraver of fifteen designs. The prospectus further states that ""the original Drawings, and a Specimen of the Stile of Engraving, may be seen at the Proprietor's, Mr. Cromek."" The ""Specimen"" is probably this white-line etching of <i>Deaths Door</i>. Its rugged and primitive boldness, coupled with public reaction to such a ""Style of Engraving,"" apparently convinced Cromek to find another craftsman to engrave Blake's designs. In a second prospectus, also of November 1805, Cromek announced that Luigi (or Louis) Schiavonetti would engrave twelve designs for the new edition. Blake had lost both the chance to introduce one of his highly individual graphic techniques into a commercial project and the potentially lucrative commission to engrave his own designs. His relationship with Cromek soon descended into anger and argument. The volume with Schiavonetti's engravings was not published until 1808.</p> <p>This is the only known impression of the white-line <i>Deaths Door</i>; it may be the one Cromek displayed to the public.</p>",esxiii.info.xml,0,

Several early drawings, such as the <cite>Satan, Sin, and Death</cite> of c. 1780 (Butlin 101), were probably inspired by Milton. In 1790-92, Blake loosely sketched several illustrations to <cite>Paradise Lost</cite> in his <cite>Notebook</cite> (Butlin 201).

His illuminated book, <cite>Europe a Prophecy</cite> (1794), clearly shows the influence of Milton's ode. By 1809, Blake may have taken a renewed interest in the poem because of his increasingly Christocentric theological views. His harsh criticism of classical civilization resonates with two of the ""Nativity"" designs, ""The Old Dragon"" and ""The Overthrow of Apollo and the Pagan Gods"" (Objects 3 and 4).

Although we can be confident that Butts was the first owner of these illustrations and very probably commissioned them, there are no extant records of such a commission. The dating of the water colors is based on the presence of an ""1816"" watermark in six of the designs and on stylistic features, particularly the high degree of finish with fine brush strokes, indicative of Blake's later style.</p><p>Each design is accompanied by a separate sheet of paper on which Blake wrote in pen and ink a brief title, now considered the verso of each sheet because glued to a backing sheet.

These quotations and comments are of course important in understanding Blake's pictorial responses to ""L'Allegro"" and ""Il Penseroso."" The rectos of these inscribed sheets are presented here, each following the water color to which it refers.

The twelve designs for <i>Paradise Regained</i> presented here are on the same paper, watermarked 1816, Blake used for the ""L'Allegro"" and ""Il Penseroso"" designs. Dated by Butlin to c. 1816-20, the <cite>Paradise Regained</cite> designs may have also been commissioned by Butts, but they were apparently either never delivered to him, or returned by him to Blake, since John Linnell's account books indicate that he purchased the designs directly from Blake in 1825. Thus it is possible that the <cite>Paradise Regained</cite> designs were produced at a later date, c. 1820-25, on commission for Linnell.</p><p>The <cite>Paradise Regained</cite> designs exemplify Blake's mature style as a water colorist and his close attention to the text he is illustrating. Many of the designs significantly juxtapose the dignified symmetry and calm repose of Blake's portrayals of Christ with the anxious and twisting energies of Satan. Through the deployment of such postures and gestures, Blake dramatizes the poem's conflict between divine imagination and satanic materialism. This struggle offers a pictorial analogue to the contests between the Zoas and their Spectres or Selfhoods in Blake's epic poems.</p><p>Blake's literary response to the life and works of John Milton finds its fullest expression in the illuminated book <cite>Milton a Poem</cite>.</p>",but544.info.xml,0,
Milton a Poem,illbk,c. 1804-1811,milton.a.p2.100.jpg,"milton.d,milton.c,milton.b,milton.a",milton,"<p>One of Blake's two final epics, <cite>Milton</cite> follows the titular hero in a journey of self-discovery and renewal. In the poem's first ""Book,"" John Milton returns from heaven to the mortal world and unites with the imagination through the person of William Blake. Together, they set out to reconfigure the relationship between a living poet and a great predecessor. In the second and final book, Milton unites with his feminine aspect, Ololon, in progress towards the apocalyptic overcoming of divisions between the sexes, between the living and the dead, and between human consciousness and its alienated projections into the external world. This plot is integrated with expansive references and allusions that range from the Bible to Blake's own life, particularly the difficult relationship with his patron William Hayley. Portions of <cite>The Four Zoas</cite>, Blake's long manuscript poem, are repeated (often with little revision) in <cite>Milton</cite>.</p><p>Blake etched forty-five plates for <cite>Milton</cite> in relief, with some full-page designs in white-line etching, between c. 1804 (the date on the title page) and c. 1811. Six additional plates (a-f) were probably etched in subsequent years up to 1818. No copy contains all fifty-one plates. The prose ""Preface"" (Plate 2) appears only in Copies A and B. Plates a-e appear only in Copies C and D, Plate f only in Copy D. The first printing, late in 1810 or early in 1811, produced Copies A-C. Blake retained Copy C and added new plates and rearranged others at least twice; the volume was not finished until c. 1821. Copy D was printed in 1818. As a partly masked white-line inscription on the title page suggests, Blake may have originally planned to write twelve ""Books"" for <cite>Milton</cite>.</p>",milton.info.xml,0,

This group, designated Copy A of <i>A Large Book of Designs</i> and now in the British Museum, includes the design only from <i>Visions of the Daughters of Albion</i> Plate 7, a rejected plate from <i>America</i> with fragments of its text obscured by the printed colors to create a design usually entitled ""A Dream of Thiralatha,"" four full-page designs etched in relief, and two plates originally etched and engraved in intaglio. These last two, ""Albion rose"" and ""The Accusers of Theft Adultery Murder,"" were color printed from their surfaces, not the incised lines, to create prints similar to those pulled from millboards used in the large color prints designed and executed the previous year.</p><p>Although apparently bound together at one time, Blake did not stab the leaves and may have issued <i>A Large Book of Designs</i> Copy A as unbound color prints. The impressions are not numbered and do not appear to constitute a sequential series. When Blake was printing Copy A for Humphry, he apparently pulled an impression of each plate to build up his stock of works. The thinner color printing in these latter impressions indicates that they are second pulls with little if any addition of color to the copperplates. This group, often referred to as Copy B of <i>A Large Book of Designs</i>, is now dispersed into several collections. There is no evidence that Copy B was issued by Blake as a sequential series; it does not constitute a ""copy"" or even a ""work"" as usually defined.</p>",bb85.info.xml,0,

The poem is in many respects a heterodox rewriting of Genesis, one in which the creation of the universe is seen as a fall into materiality and its abstract laws. The process is initiated by Urizen when he separates himself from his fellow ""Eternals"" and thereby creates difference, absence, and self-consciousness. As Urizen falls into this void of his own making, Los reacts by building a material and temporal base below which Urizen cannot descend. Through this narrative of ultimate origins, Blake explores fundamental epistemological and ontological issues.</p> <p>Blake etched in shallow relief the twenty-eight plates of <cite>The [First] Book of Urizen</cite> in 1794, although only Copies A and B contain them all.

Sketchbook Containing Drawings for the Engraved Illustrations to the Book of Job,penc,1823,but557.1.1.pd.100.jpg,but557.1,but557,"<p>Blake's pictorial engagements with The Book of Job extended over many decades.  His first efforts were a small group of wash drawings of the mid-1780s showing Job in his misery with his wife and three friends (Butlin 162-164).  Another version of this subject appears among Blake's emblem series he sketched in his Notebook (Butlin 201.20), but the composition appearing in the wash drawings culminated in the large intaglio etching/engraving, ""Job"" (Essick V) which Blake listed in his advertisement <i>To the Public</i> of 10 October 1793.  This print may have stimulated Blake's chief patron, Thomas Butts, to commission a tempera painting, <i>Job and His Daughters</i> (Butlin 394) c. 1799-1800 and, about six years later, a series of nineteen water colors illustrating the story of Job (Butlin 550, the so-called ""Butts set"").  In 1821, Blake and his new patron John Linnell borrowed the water colors from Butts.  Linnell traced the series and Blake colored them (Butlin 551, the so-called ""Linnell set"").  Blake also added two more compositions to this later group and added versions of these same compositions to the earlier group, so that both sets now have twenty-one designs.  The Linnell set led directly to his commissioning engravings.  These began as a series of reduced sketches executed in 1823 (Butlin 557); the engravings themselves, with a title page added, were not finished and published until 1826.</p><p>The sketchbook containing the reduced drawings, preparatory for the engravings, is presented here.  We have reproduced the full leaves, edge to edge, to give a sense of the work as a whole and to include the numbers top right, possibly inscribed by Linnell or a member of his family.  Also included are the covers that bear inscriptions, one by John Linnell (Object 3), and others possibly attributable to Blake, Linnell, or members of Linnell's family (Objects 1 and 32).</p><p>Blake follows the general outline of the story of Job in the Bible, but also incorporates into his designs many motifs representing his personal interpretation.  At the beginning, Job and his family attend only to the letter, rather than the spirit, of God's laws.  Job thereby falls under a false conception of God and into the hands of Satan.  Job's sufferings are recorded in the first half of the series, culminating in his horrific vision of a devil-god in the eleventh design.  Job's spiritual education and material restoration are pictured in the second half of the series.  In the penultimate design, Job tells his story to his daughters; the entire family is restored to life in the final design.  Some critics and biographers have interpreted the Job series as personal statements about Blake's own tribulations and the spiritual peace he found late in life.  However appealing this approach may be, it is made questionable by the earlier dating of the Butts series, the basis for all the later works.</p>",but557.info.xml,0,
"Drawings for Mary Wollstonecraft's ""Original Stories from Real Life""",mono,1791,but244.1.1.wd.100.jpg,but244.1,but244,"<p>In 1788, Joseph Johnson published the first edition of Mary Wollstonecraft's morally instructive narrative for children, <i>Original Stories from Real Life; with Conversations, Calculated to Regulate the Affections, and Form the Mind to Truth and Goodness</i>.  A few years later, Johnson decided to issue a new edition, for which he commissioned Blake to prepare a series of illustrations.  Blake's extant drawings, now in the Library of Congress, are presented here.  In addition to these ten designs, Blake must have executed at least one further drawing as a preliminary for his fifth plate; this drawing is untraced.  A total of six designs were selected for publication in the 1791 edition of Wollstonecraft's book (Bentley 514); revised states were published in the 1796 edition.  Blake engraved the designs himself.</p><p>Modern interpreters of the illustrations for <i>Original Stories</i> have detected a pictorial critique of Wollstonecraft's stories.  Blake appears to have found her morality too calculating, rationalistic, and rigid.  He represents Wollstonecraft's spokesperson, Mrs. Mason, as a domineering presence.  From Blake's perspective, Mason's acts of charity are excessively condescending and tend to reinforce the underlying social conditions that create disparities between wealth and poverty.  As Blake wrote in ""The Human Abstract,"" ""Pity would be no more, / If we did not make somebody Poor"" (Erdman page 27).</p>",but244.info.xml,0,

Other inscriptions surrounding the central design set forth Blake's interrelated opinions on money, empire, morality, Christianity, and the arts. The central image of the statue may have been executed as early as c. 1815 in connection with Blake's work on illustrations for Abraham Rees, <i>The Cyclopaedia; or, Universal Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, and Literature</i>. The inscribed texts surrounding the statue were almost certainly added at a much later date, c. 1826-27. Both impressions (A and B) of the single plate, etched and engraved in intaglio, were printed in 1826 or 1827.</p>",laocoon.info.xml,0,
Illustrations of the Book of Job,spb,1823-26,bb421.1.1.sp.100.jpg,bb421.1,bb421,"<p>Blake's twenty-two engraved Illustrations of the Book of Job are the culmination of his long pictorial engagement with that biblical subject. His first efforts were a small group of wash drawings of the mid-1780s showing Job in his misery with his wife and three friends (Butlin 162-64). Another version of this subject appears among Blake's emblem series he sketched in his Notebook (Butlin 201.20), but the composition appearing in the wash drawings became the basis for the large intaglio etching/engraving, ""Job"" (Essick V), which Blake listed in his advertisement <cite>To the Public</cite> of 10 October 1793.

Blake first executed a series of twenty-one reduced pencil sketches of the central designs (Butlin 557). These he transferred to copperplates. Rather than using the customary ""mixed method"" of preliminary etching followed by engraving, Blake used pure line engraving in the Job plates. Perhaps one of his motivations was to evoke the art of the master engravers of the Renaissance whom Blake greatly admired, such as Albrecht D&uuml;rer. The Job engravings are generally considered to be Blake's masterpiece as an intaglio printmaker.</p><p>According to John Linnell, the border designs, unique to the engraved series, were a last-minute addition to the copperplates. Blake also added a title page, perhaps late in the production process. The title page is not numbered, but all the others are numbered, upper right in the copperplate, 1-21. The plate numbered ""1"" (Object 3 here) was mistakenly dated 1828 in the imprint; all the others were dated 1825. Linnell's account books show that the engravings were not published until March 1826.</p><p>Blake follows the general outline of the story of Job in the Bible, but also incorporates into his designs many motifs representing his personal interpretation.

A Small Book of Designs,spb,1796,bb136.a.1.sp.100.jpg,bb136.a,bb136,"<p>The miniature portrait painter Ozias Humphry commissioned Blake to print ""a selection from the different Books of such as could be Printed without the Writing,"" as Blake wrote Dawson Turner in a letter of 9 June 1818 (Erdman page 771). These impressions of the designs only from Blake's illuminated books were richly color printed, very probably in 1796, the date Blake wrote on an impression of <i>The First Book of Urizen</i> Plate 1 in Copy B of <i>A Small Book of Designs</i>. Copy A, now in the British Museum, was prepared for Humphry and passed from his collection to his son, William Upcott. Blake or his wife Catherine gathered the 23 impressions with string through three holes, the method they used in his illuminated books, but he did not number them; they may not constitute a sequential series but simply a gathering of beautifully color printed designs.</p><p>When preparing the set of prints for Humphry in 1796, Blake apparently pulled a second impression of each plate (or at least of most of them) to build up his own stock of works. These impressions, now widely dispersed and eight not discovered until 2007, constitute most of Copy B of <i>A Small Book of Designs</i>. The thinner color printing in the Copy B impressions indicates that they are second pulls with little if any addition of color to the copperplates between pulls. Like those in Copy A, these impressions were stabbed through three holes. Many years later, probably c. 1818 or later, Blake added pen and ink framing lines around the prints (similar to those in <i>Songs</i> Copies R and V, both in the Archive), inscribed most of them with verse captions, and numbered them, apparently to indicate their order in a series. Blake had at least 22 numbered and framed impressions at one time, although subsequent treatment (or mistreatment) led to the erasure of some of the numbers and the trimming of the framing lines and captions.</p><p>Shared stab holes indicate that Copy B was at one time bound, probably by Blake or his wife Catherine. Three plates in Copy B&mdash;<i>The First Book of Urizen</i> Plates 9, 12, and 22&mdash;are not present in Copy A. These three impressions were probably not pulled during the 1796 printing of Copy A but were printed as part of Blake's production of color printed copies of <i>Urizen</i> in 1794. They are all full-page designs without text and thus could be incorporated into a group specifically printed without texts.</p><p>In his 1818 letter to Turner, Blake explains, with a note of regret, that the color prints for Humphry were created ""with the Loss of some of the best things For they when Printed perfect accompany Poetical Personifications &amp; Acts without which Poems they never could have been Executed"" (Erdman page 771). Although the impressions in <i>A Small Book of Designs</i> are some of Blake's finest works as a color printer, their separation from the texts of the illuminated books sacrifices the interplay between words and images. Blake's attitude toward the Book of Designs when he produced them may have differed from his much later statements to Turner.  Perhaps the verses he added to Copy B at about the same time he was writing to Turner were attempts to compensate for that loss.</p>",bb136.info.xml,0,
For Children: The Gates of Paradise,illbk,1793,gates-child.d.p2.100.jpg,gates-child.d,gates-child,"<p>Through a numbered series of emblems with inscriptions ranging from single words to brief aphorisms, Blake puts the course of human life from birth to death in psychological perspective.

In Copy A the title page is a proof that bears fragments of an erased imprint that may refer to J. Dodsley as the publisher or co-publisher. There is no other evidence that either Johnson (a bookseller for whom Blake executed many engravings) or Dodsley actually participated in the publication or selling of the book. Copy D has been supplemented with two plates (19, 20) etched c. 1820 as part of Blake's revision of <cite>For Children</cite> into <cite>For the Sexes: The Gates of Paradise</cite>, plus an additional impression of Plate 2 in its later, <cite>For the Sexes</cite>, state.</p>",gates-child.info.xml,0,

While historical figures such as Washington and Paine appear, much of the symbolic and thematic weight is placed on Blake's own invented mythological figures, including ""Albions Angel"" and ""Londons Guardian"" (forces of the British government), Urizen (the god of restrictive reason and the origin of political repression), and fiery Orc (the spirit of revolt). The American Revolution is viewed as a harbinger of universal revolution, epistemological as much as political.</p><p>In 1793, Blake etched in relief, with considerable white-line work in some designs, and first printed twenty-three plates for <cite>America</cite>. These include eighteen major text and design plates used in all complete copies, a small plate (e) bearing the word ""Preludium"" and printed above the design on Plate 3, and four plates (a-d) never published, perhaps because of potentially actionable references to ""the King"" and ""George.""

Illustrations to Gray's Poems,wc,c. 1797-98,but335.1.1.wc.100.jpg,but335.1,but335,"<p>The 116 water-color illustrations to Thomas Gray's poems are among Blake's major achievements as an illustrator. They were commissioned in 1797 by Blake's friend, the sculptor John Flaxman, as a gift for his wife Ann, to whom Blake addressed the poem that ends the series. The commission may have been inspired by the Flaxmans' seeing Blake's water-color designs to Edward Young's <i>Night Thoughts</i>, begun in 1795. The Gray illustrations follow the same basic format. Blake cut windows in large sheets of the same type of Whatman paper used for the <i>Night Thoughts</i> illustrations and mounted in these windows the texts of Gray's poems from a 1790 octavo edition published by John Murray, leaving out some prefatory materials, fly-titles, the notes, and the 7 engraved illustrations. Blake then drew and colored his designs surrounding the letterpress texts. On blank versos near the beginning of each poem, and in one case on a separate piece of paper pasted over letterpress text, Blake inscribed with pen and ink either titles for each design or quotations from the poem to indicate the passage illustrated. On most text pages, Blake also drew a pencil cross left of the first line of the illustrated passage. He numbered most leaves consecutively in pen and ink, beginning a new sequence for each of the 13 poems.</p><p>Blake conceived of his work as an illustrated book, rather than a series of unbound designs, as indicated by his offsetting Gray's texts above and to the right (left on versos) from the middle of each leaf&mdash;then the convention for all letterpress books. Although listed by William Michael Rossetti in his catalogue of Blake's drawings and paintings, published in the 1863 and 1880 editions of Alexander Gilchrist's <i>Life of William Blake</i>, the Gray illustrations were virtually unknown until their rediscovery by Herbert Grierson in 1919.</p><p>Blake's illustrations respond to Gray's poems in a variety of ways, but always with respect for the specifics in the text. Many motifs are visualizations&mdash;and hence literalizations&mdash;of Gray's metaphoric images. The Gray illustrations share iconographic and stylistic similarities with the <i>Night Thoughts</i> designs; both series are indebted to the pictorial imagery Blake developed in his illuminated books of the early- and mid-1790s. For the more comic passages in Gray's poems, Blake deployed a broad, almost caricature-like style. Many of the designs emphasize the imagination at work in the world through inspired acts of reading, writing, and performing music. </p>",but335.info.xml,0,
"Robert Blair, The Grave",comdes,c. 1805-08,b435.1.1.com.100.jpg,bb435.1,bb435,"<p>In October 1805, Blake was commissioned by the engraver and would-be publisher Robert H. Cromek to prepare forty drawings illustrating Robert Blair's <i>The Grave</i>, a popular ""Graveyard"" school poem first published in 1743. Cromek planned to select twenty of these designs for a deluxe edition of the poem. In Cromek's first prospectus of November 1805, Blake is named as both the designer and engraver of fifteen designs. Blake etched one image, <a href=""&#xA; /blake/copy/esxiii.1?descId=esxiii.1.spb.01""> <i>Deaths Door</i></a>, in white-line, but Cromek rejected it. The dark power of the white-line print appeals to modern tastes, but was far from fashionable in the early nineteenth century. In a second prospectus, also of November 1805, Cromek announced that Luigi (or Louis) Schiavonetti would engrave twelve designs for the new edition. Blake had lost the potentially lucrative commission to engrave his own designs; his relationship with Cromek descended into anger and argument. In spite of their disagreement, Cromek included a portrait of Blake as a frontispiece to the volume, published in 1808. Cromek promoted the book aggressively and the illustrations to <i>The Grave</i> became Blake's best known work through much of the nineteenth century.</p> <p>The published volume includes Blake's dedicatory poem ""To the Queen,"" a prefatory comment on the designs by Henry Fuseli, and a concluding section ""Of the Designs"" (unsigned, but probably by Benjamin Heath Malkin). The last presents an alternative arrangement of the plates independent of the textual sequence of lines illustrated. A second edition was published by Rudolph Ackermann in 1813; he also reprinted the plates, with inscribed titles in Spanish, in Jose Joaquin de Mora's <i>Meditaciones Poeticas</i> (1826), a series of poems written in response to Blake's designs. Nineteen of the finished water-color preliminary drawings for <i>The Grave</i> were rediscovered in 2001, as noted for each in the list of ""Related Works,"" below. For this group, see ""<a href=""&#xA; /blake/work/butwba10"">Illustrations to Robert Blair's <i>The Grave</i></a>"" under Water Color Drawings in the main table of ""Works in the William Blake Archive.""

His selection of subjects and themes emphasizes immortality more than the death, the latter often presented as a passage to the former. Although Cromek very probably made the final selection of designs to publish, they tend to fall into contrastive pairs in format and theme&mdash;e.g., death of the wicked man/death of the good man, parting of the soul and body/reunion of the soul and body.</p>",but435.info.xml,0,
"Illustrations to Milton's ""On the Morning of Christ's Nativity"", The Thomas Set",wc,1809,but538.1.1.wc.100.jpg,but538.1,but538,"<p>The poetry of John Milton was important to Blake as both poet and artist from his earliest years. As he told John Flaxman in a letter of 12 September 1800, ""Milton lovd me in childhood &amp; shewd me his face"" (Erdman page 707). Several early drawings, such as the <cite>Satan, Sin, and Death</cite> of c. 1780 (Butlin 101), were probably inspired by Milton. In 1790-92, Blake loosely sketched several illustrations to <cite>Paradise Lost</cite> in his <cite>Notebook</cite> (Butlin 201; see Related Works, below). He composed his first series of water colors illustrating one of Milton's poems in 1801 when the Rev. Joseph Thomas commissioned eight designs for <cite>Comus</cite> (Butlin 527). In 1809, Blake produced for Thomas a set of six illustrations to Milton's ""On the Morning of Christ's Nativity"" (Butlin 538). Blake repeated the same basic ""Nativity Ode"" designs, with many minor but intriguing variations, for his main patron, Thomas Butts, in about 1815 (Butlin 542). This later series is presented here. The date is based on stylistic considerations&mdash;see the Note following Composition Date on the Work Information page. When sold at auction in 1852, the water colors were accompanied by the poem, or possibly only the passages illustrated, in manuscript. This now-lost text may have been written by Blake, like the transcriptions in his hand of the passages illustrated still with his ""L'Allegro"" and ""Il Penseroso"" illustrations (Butlin 543).</p> <p>Blake's interest in the ""Nativity Ode"" began long before his execution of the Thomas set of water colors. His illuminated book, <cite>Europe a Prophecy</cite> (1794), clearly shows the influence of Milton's ode. By 1809, Blake may have taken a renewed interest in the poem because of his increasingly Christocentric theological views. His harsh criticism of classical civilization resonates with two of the ""Nativity"" designs, ""The Old Dragon"" and ""The Overthrow of Apollo and the Pagan Gods"" (Objects 3 and 4). Modern critics have been hard pressed to find Blake dissenting from Milton's own iconography and perspectives in the ode.</p> <p>Blake's literary response to the life and works of John Milton finds its fullest expression in the illuminated book <cite>Milton a Poem</cite>.</p>",btu538.info.xml,0,
The Order in which the Songs of Innocence & of Experience ought to be paged & placed,ms,c. 1821 or later?,bb125.1.1.ms.100.jpg,bb125.1,bb125,"<p>Blake probably wrote this two-page manuscript, often called the ""Order"" of the <cite>Songs</cite>, in about 1821.  Its purpose is a little mysterious.  Only Copy V of <cite>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</cite> contains plates bound in the numbered sequence recorded in this manuscript.  Oddly, there is no evidence in the history of these two works to indicate that they were ever bound together or otherwise physically associated.  Indeed, the manuscript's provenance does not associate it with any copy of the <cite>Songs</cite>.  In addition to its numbered sequence of titles, the manuscript contains two or three series of check marks; these do not accord precisely to any known copy of the illuminated book.  Perhaps Blake wrote this manuscript as a guide for arranging the plates of the <cite>Songs</cite>, used that sequence only in one copy, rejected the arrangement in all later copies, and then used it simply as a check-sheet to record available impressions of his plates for <cite>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</cite>.</p>",bb125.info.xml,0,
The Pickering Manuscript,ms,c. 1807,bb126.1.1.ms.100.jpg,bb126.1,bb126,"<p>An intriguing glimpse of the Pickering Manuscript poems surfaces on 16 August 1803, the month before Blake's return to London after three years in Felpham, Sussex. The increasingly miserable artist-in-residence for William Hayley writes his London friend and patron Thomas Butts a letter that attempts to give some ""Picture of my Present state I pray God to keep you &amp; all men from it &amp; to deliver me in his own good time."" Blake's verbal self-portrait culminates in three stanzas that open with an exclamatory couplet: ""O why was I born with a different face / Why was I not born like the rest of my race"" (Erdman pages 733-34). </p> <p>He varied that couplet only slightly in the separate poem ""<a href=""&#xA; /blake/copy/bb126.1?descId=bb126.1.ms.08"">Mary</a>,"" which may have been composed around the same time. At some point he copied ""Mary"" neatly into a 22-page manuscript with nine other poems, seven known from no other source. Not earlier than 1802, probably after the abandonment of the quarto <i>Ballads</i> project in 1805 (see Blake's letter to William Hayley, 22 January 1805, Erdman pages 762-63), Blake reutilized paper that had been used in Hayley's <i>Designs to a Series of Ballads</i>, 1802 (to which Blake had contributed engraved illustrations), trimmed off Hayley's printed texts (and with them the 1802 watermark), and on the spacious inside margins wrote out the ten poems that constitute the Pickering Manuscript&mdash;named after B. M. Pickering (1836-1878), one of its several nineteenth century owners.</p> <p>The poems may have been composed from about 1800 through perhaps 1804 (see Bentley, <i>Blake Books</i> pages 341-42). In the final manuscript version, the clarity and formality of the hand, the neatness and uniformity of the arrangement, the scarcity of changes, and even the number of poems tantalizingly suggest a specific occasion for the collection. But there are no designs, no title page, and no concrete evidence to indicate whether Blake intended some form of publication or, perhaps, as David Erdman suggests, made the collection for a friend or patron (Erdman page 859n). If so, that friend or patron never received it. It remained with Blake's wife Catherine after his death in 1827. The poems were not published until 1866&mdash;the year Pickering bought the manuscript&mdash;in <i>Songs of Innocence and Experience, with Other Poems</i>, edited by R. H. Shepherd.</p> <p>In attempts to capture the character of the collection in a title, it has also been called the Ballads Manuscript (Bentley) and the Auguries Manuscript (Johnson and Grant). Its sometimes ballad-like poems range in length from sixteen lines in four stanzas reminiscent of the <i>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</i> (""<a href=""&#xA; /blake/copy/bb126.1?descId=bb126.1.ms.01"">The Smile</a>"") to one undivided sequence of 132 aphoristic lines (""<a href=""&#xA; /blake/copy/bb126.1?descId=bb126.1.ms.13"">Auguries of Innocence</a>""), with the other poems at various lengths in between. All have, in one way or another, strong precedents in earlier work&mdash;characteristic subject matter, ideology, and attitude; ballad- and hymn-like structures built upon characteristic rhythms, rhymes, and repetitions; a striking penchant (and talent) for aphorism and invented proverb; and strong ironies in strange mixtures of story and saying, among other familiar traits. No one who has read the <i>Songs</i> and the Proverbs of Hell in <i>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</i> will fail to recognize the poetic neighborhood of the Pickering Manuscript as Blake's.</p> <p>But he must have sensed that these were ten instances of particularly masterful&mdash;refined, powerful, compelling, inspired&mdash;poetry underwritten by an increasingly codified mythology. Thus one of the most elegant and memorable narratives of the Pickering group, ""The Mental Traveller,"" is the kind of poem that has helped give Blake the reputation of an artist who ""must Create a System, or be enslav'd by another Mans"" (as his hero Los says in <i>Jerusalem</i> Plate 10, Erdman page 153). Like some other poems in the group, ""The Mental Traveller"" comes across as a module that Blake could easily have slipped into his more extended mythopoeic ventures. It encapsulates with extraordinary concision a smooth, dark core of Blake's storytelling: ""She lives upon his shrieks &amp; cries / And She grows young as he grows old"" (<a href=""&#xA; /blake/copy/bb126.1?descId=bb126.1.ms.03"">Object 3</a>). Like most of the poems in this grouping, ""The Mental Traveller"" is sharp but enigmatic, as if it can simultaneously know precisely what it is about but remain baffling to readers who want to crack its code.</p> <p>Then again, the manuscript also beckons to readers (and poets, artists, and musicians, because these are among Blake's most influential lines) who want light with their darkness&mdash;who prefer their unsparing social insights balanced against hope and healing. This attractive, popular Blake is best represented here in the long aphoristic sequence ""Auguries of Innocence,"" where ""under every grief &amp; pine / Runs a joy with silken twine,"" ""Man was made for Joy &amp; Woe,"" and it is possible ""To see a World in a Grain of Sand / And a Heaven in a Wild Flower / Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand / And Eternity in an hour"" (<a href=""&#xA; /blake/copy/bb126.1?descId=bb126.1.ms.16"">Object 16</a>). Miraculous acts of imagination can be achieved even in a world where ""The Harlots cry from Street to Street / Shall weave Old Englands winding Sheet"" (<a href=""&#xA; /blake/copy/bb126.1?descId=bb126.1.ms.18"">Object 18</a>) and ""The Babe that weeps the Rod beneath / Writes Revenge in realms of death"" (<a href=""&#xA; /blake/copy/bb126.1?descId=bb126.1.ms.16"">Object 16</a>).</p>",bb126.info.xml,0,
"Illustrations to Milton's ""Paradise Lost"", The Linnell Set",wc,1822,but537.1.1.wc.100.jpg,but537.1,but537,"<p> The poetry of John Milton was important to Blake as both poet and artist from his earliest years. As he told John Flaxman in a letter of 12 September 1800, ""Milton lovd me in childhood &amp; shewd me his face"" (Erdman page 707). Several early drawings, such as the <cite>Satan, Sin, and Death</cite> of c. 1780 (Butlin 101), were probably inspired by Milton. In 1790-92, Blake loosely sketched several illustrations to <cite>Paradise Lost</cite> in his <cite>Notebook</cite> (Butlin 201).

In the next year, Blake executed another series of twelve <cite>Paradise Lost</cite> designs, with a larger format, for Thomas Butts (Butlin 536, sometimes called the ""large"" set). </p><p> We know from John Linnell's journal that Blake ""began copies from his Drawings from Miltons P.L."" on 9 May 1822 (Butlin page 388). This is almost certainly a reference to the three water colors illustrating <cite>Paradise Lost</cite> presented here (Butlin 537). They were probably commissioned by Linnell and remained in his family's possession until their dispersal at auction in 1918. It may have been Blake's intention to produce another set of twelve water colors, much as he had produced for Linnell a complete set of water colors illustrating the Book of Job in 1821, but only the three extant designs are known. They are based on the fourth, eighth, and eleventh illustrations in the Butts series. In comparison to these models, the Linnell water colors show an increased emphasis on dramatic lighting, particularly evident in the radiance surrounding Christ in ""Michael Foretells the Crucifixion"" (Object 3). </p><p>Blake's literary response to the life and works of John Milton finds its fullest expression in the illuminated book <cite>Milton a Poem</cite>.</p>",but537.info.xml,0,

He composed his first series of water colors illustrating one of Milton's poems in 1801 when the Rev. Joseph Thomas commissioned the eight designs for <i>Comus</i> (Butlin 527) presented here. This commission and its date are established by John Flaxman's comment in a postscript to Blake in a letter to William Hayley of 31 July 1801: ""The Revd. Joseph Thomas of Epsom desires you will at your leisure, make a few sketches of the same size [as each other], which maybe any size you please from Milton's Comus for Five Guineas"" (Butlin volume 1, page 373). Thomas later acquired (very probably on commission) a set of twelve water color illustrations to <i>Paradise Lost</i> in 1807 (Butlin 529) and six water colors illustrating ""On the Morning of Christ's Nativity"" in 1809 (Butlin 538). In about 1815, Blake produced another set of <i>Comus</i> designs for his patron Thomas Butts (Butlin 528).

Although we can be confident that Butts was the first owner of these illustrations and very probably commissioned them, there are no extant records of such a commission. The dating of the water colors is based on the presence of an ""1816"" watermark in six of the designs and on stylistic features, particularly the high degree of finish with fine brush strokes, indicative of Blake's later style.</p><p>Each design is accompanied by a separate sheet of paper on which Blake wrote in pen and ink a brief title, now considered the verso of each sheet because glued to a backing sheet. The rectos of the inscribed sheets bear pen and ink quotations, in Blake's hand, of the lines illustrated, to which Blake added his own comments on the motifs pictured. These quotations and comments are of course important in understanding Blake's pictorial responses to ""L'Allegro"" and ""Il Penseroso."" The rectos of these inscribed sheets are presented here, each following the water color to which it refers.
